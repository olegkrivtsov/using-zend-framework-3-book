# Appendix D. Introduction to Doctrine {#doctrine-intro}

In this appendix, we provide overview of the Doctrine library, such as its 
architecture and components. Since in this book we concentrate mainly on Doctrine's Object Relational Mapper (ORM) 
component, reading this appendix may give you the bigger picture of other Doctrine capabilities.

## Doctrine and Database Management Systems

There are many database management systems (DBMS) on the market. Those systems can be divided into two
groups: traditional *relational databases* utilizing SQL language for querying and manipulating data, 
and *NoSQL databases* utilizing "not only SQL" methods for 
accessing and managing the data. In each particular project you may prefer certain DBMS because of 
its capabilities and competitive advantages.

### Relational Databases

In a *relational database*, you have a collection of tables (relations) consisting of rows. A row may 
have one or several columns. A row (or several rows) of a table may be linked to a row
(or several rows) of another table, thus forming a relationship between data.

For example, assume you have a blog website whose database contains two tables: the `post` table
and the `comment` table. The `post` table would have columns named `id`, `title`, `content`, `author`, `date_created`;
and the `comment` table would have columns named `id`, `post_id`, `author`, `content`, and `date_created`. 
The `post` table is related to `comment` table as one-to-many, because one post has zero or more (many) comments, 
while a certain comment may belong to a single post only. 

Graphically, the above mentioned tables, their columns and relationship are shown in figure D.1 below.

![Figure D.1. Tables and relationship between tables. Single post has many comments](images/doctrine_intro/post_comment_relationship.png)

On the market, there is a number of major relational databases. Among them: [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org), 
[MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/), [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/index.html), 
[Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/sql-server), etc. 

Each database system has its own features specific to that DBMS and which are not part of other 
systems. For example: 
 
  * SQLite is designed as an embed extension of PHP engine and doesn't require installation, however it 
    works well for simple sites only; 
    
  * MySQL is a free system which is very simple in installation and administration and 
    good for using in systems varying from small to middle scale;
    
  * Commercial Oracle DBMS is mainly targeted on large-scale systems and has sophisticated 
    administrative tools;
    
  * PostgreSQL supports indefinitely large databases and can be considered as an open-source replacement
    of Oracle.  

Doctrine library is designed to work with all major databases using a unified programming interface.
This programming interface is implemented in two levels:

  1. At the lower level, Doctrine provides the unified mechanism for building SQL queries to any supported 
     relational database and manipulating database schema. This mechanism is implemented in the 
	 *Database Abstraction Layer* (DBAL) component.

  2. At the higher level, the *Object Relational Mapper* (ORM) component of Doctrine provides an
     ability to query and manage database data in object-oriented way, by mapping the tables to PHP 
	 classes. This component also provides its custom database query language called DQL allowing to build queries
	 in object-oriented style.
	 
Typically, you use the API provided by high-level ORM component. At the same time, you can easily 
work with lower-level DBAL component, if you find that more suitable for your particular needs.
	
I> Doctrine is database-agnostic. In theory, when you use Doctrine you are able to abstract of database type 
I> and switch between databases more easily than when you use your database-dependent solution.

#### SQL vs. DQL 
    
When using a relational database system, you typically use *SQL language* as a standard way for accessing 
database data and managing database schema. However, each DBMS usually has it own specific SQL language 
extensions (dialects).
    
I> Doctrine library is designed to work with all major relational database systems that use SQL language, 
I> but it is obvious that it supports only some subset of their functionality and SQL language capabilities. 

Doctrine is built on top of PHP PDO extension (and other database-specific PHP extensions, like `sqlite`, `mysqli`, 
`oci8`, etc.). Those extensions provide drivers for all major relational database systems. You specify which 
driver to use when configuring a database connection.

T> If you are not familiar with SQL, a good point for learning its syntax is 
T> [W3Schools Tutorials](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp).

[^pdo]: The PHP Data Objects (PDO) extension defines a lightweight, consistent interface for accessing 
        databases in PHP. To make it in database-agnostic way, PDO uses the concept of database drivers. 
        Each database driver that implements the PDO interface can expose database-specific 
        features as regular extension functions. 

Since the Object Relational Mapper component of Doctrine is designed to work with objects instead of tables,
it provides its own "object-oriented" query language called *DQL* [^dql]. It is similar to SQL in sense
that it allows to write and execute queries to database, but result of a query is an array of objects rather 
than an array of table rows.

[^dql]: DQL stands for Doctrine Query Language.
		
### NoSQL Databases

In contrast to a relational database system, a NoSQL database system - as its name assumes - uses a
not-only-SQL method of accessing the data. This means that each NoSQL system may provide its own
custom methods and API for accessing and manipulating the data. Technically, NoSQL 
databases can be divided in the following groups:

  * **Document Store**. A document database operates the concept of *documents and their fields*. This is useful,
    for example, if you have an hierarchical document tree in a content management (CMS) system. Documents are 
    addressed in the database via a unique key that represents that document. One of the other defining 
    characteristics of a document-oriented database is that, beyond the simple key-document 
    lookup that you can use to retrieve a document, the database will offer an API or query language that 
    will allow retrieval of documents based on their contents.
  
  * **Column Store**. Frequently used in web indexing. A column-oriented DBMS is a database management 
    system that stores data tables as sections of columns of data rather than as rows of data. 
    In comparison, most relational DBMSs store data in rows. This column-oriented DBMS has advantages 
    for data warehouses, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and library card catalogues, 
    and other ad hoc inquiry systems where aggregates are computed over large numbers of similar 
    data items.

  * **Key-Value Store**. This is the simplest data storage using unique keys for accessing certain
    data. Such database systems provide a simple key-value lookup mechanism.
    
  * and others.
  
I> Doctrine provides support only to the Document Store subset of the NoSQL database systems. Column
   store and key-value store database systems typically have very specific field of applications, and not covered by
   Doctrine.
  
#### Document Databases  

Doctrine supports a number of NoSQL document store databases: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/), 
[CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/), [OrientDB](http://www.orientechnologies.com/orientdb/) and 
[PHPCR](http://phpcr.github.io/).
    
For example, in a blog website, you would have a document named `post` and a document named `comment`.
The `post` document would have fields named `id`, `title`, `content`, `author`, `date_created`;
and the `comment` document would have fields named `id`, `author`, `content` and `date_created`. This
is very similar to the tables you would have in a relational database.

I> In this book, we do not address the Doctrine-provided API to the NoSQL document databases. If you
   want to learn about these capabilities, please refer to the corresponding sections of Doctrine project
   documentation.
   
## Doctrine Architecture

The [Doctrine Project](http://www.doctrine-project.org/) consists of several libraries (components). 
Each Doctrine component is distributed as a Composer-installable package and registered in 
[Packagist.org](https://packagist.org/) catalogue. This is very similar to the way that Zend Framework 3 
uses for installing its components.

Here we will provide you with a brief description of Doctrine library architecture 
to let you a general idea of its capabilities. 

### Components Supporting Relational Databases

Main Doctrine components designed for working with relational databases are shown in figure D.2 
and marked with green. Blue blocks denote the PHP engine and PHP extensions Doctrine is built on 
top of. 

![Figure D.2. Doctrine components designed for working with relational databases](images/doctrine_intro/doctrine_orm_architecture.png)

As you can see from the figure, Doctrine is based on PHP engine features and on PHP extensions
that are actually used as drivers to particular database management systems. Above that base layer, there 
are core Doctrine components (like `Annotations`, `Common`, etc.) providing essential functionality 
for other top-level components. The `DBAL` component provides an abstraction layer of database type. 
And on top of all that there is the `ORM` component providing API for working with data in object-oriented
way. `DoctrineModule` and `DoctrineORMModule` components are designed for integration with Zend Framework 3.

I> Doctrine ORM component uses the so called [Data Mapper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mapper_pattern) 
   pattern. This pattern tells that a database table can be represented as a PHP entity class. The database
   in this pattern is considered as some kind of repository (storage of entities). When you retrieve an
   entity from the repository, an SQL query is performed internally, and an instance of the PHP entity class
   is constructed and its properties are filled with data. 

By analogy with ZF3 components, Doctrine component names consist of two parts: the vendor name 
("Doctrine") and the component name (e.g. "Common"). Below, you can find the list of 
Doctrine components together with their Composer-installable package names and brief descriptions:

  * `Doctrine\Common`.  Common Library for Doctrine projects. This component contains commonly used 
    functionality. Its Composer-installable package name is `doctrine/common`.
  
  * `Doctrine\Annotations`. Docblock Annotations Parser. Its Composer-installable package name is 
    `doctrine/annotations`.
  
  * `Doctrine\Inflector`. Common String Manipulations with regard to casing and singular/plural rules. 
     Its Composer-installable package name is `doctrine/inflector`.
  
  * `Doctrine\Lexer`. Base library for a lexer that can be used in Top-Down, Recursive Descent Parsers. 
     Its Composer-installable package name is `doctrine/lexer`.
 
  * `Doctrine\Cache`. Caching library offering an object-oriented API for many cache backends.
     Its Composer-installable package name is `doctrine/cache`.

  * `Doctrine\DBAL`. Database Abstraction Layer. This is a lightweight and thin runtime layer around 
     a PDO-like API and a lot of additional, horizontal features like database schema introspection and 
     manipulation through an object oriented API. Its Composer-installable package name is `doctrine/dbal`.
 
  * `Doctrine\Collections`. Collections Abstraction library. Its Composer-installable package name is 
    `doctrine/collections`.

  * `Doctrine\ORM`. Object-Relational-Mapper for PHP. This is a Doctrine component providing a way to 
     work with entity models in object-oriented way instead of raw SQL queries. Its composer installable
     package name is `doctrine/orm`.

  * `Doctrine\Migrations`. Database Schema migrations using Doctrine DBAL. Provides a consistent way 
    to manage database schema and update it. Its composer installable package name is `doctrine/migrations`.

  * `Doctrine\DataFixtures`. Data Fixtures for all Doctrine Object Managers. 
    Provides a framework for making database fixtures. Its composer installable package name is 
    `doctrine/data-fixtures`.

Since Doctrine uses PHP autoloading and PSR-4 standard, classes belonging to certain component live 
in that component's namespace. For example, the `EntityManager` class belonging to `Doctrine\ORM` 
component, lives in `Doctrine\ORM` namespace.  

### Components Supporting NoSQL Document Databases

Doctrine components designed for working with NoSQL document databases (MongoDB, CouchDB, etc.) 
are shown in figure D.3 and marked with green. Blue blocks denote the PHP engine and PHP extensions 
Doctrine is built on top of. 

![Figure D.3. Doctrine components designed for working with document databases](images/doctrine_intro/doctrine_odm_architecture.png)

As you can see from the figure D.3, Doctrine NoSQL components are based on PHP engine features 
and on PHP extensions that can be considered as "drivers" to particular database management systems. 
Above that base layer, there are middle level components. The `Common` component is the same component that was shown in figure
D.2; it provides commonly used functionality. The `MongoDB` and `CouchDB` are components providing
low-level API to corresponding databases. The `MongodbODM`, `CouchdbODM`, `OrientdbODM` and `PhpcrODM`
components provide Object Document Mappers (ODM) for corresponding databases. ODM concept is very
similar to ORM in sense that it provides an ability to work with a NoSQL database in object oriented
way by mapping a document to a PHP entity class. The `DoctrineMongoODMModule` component is intended
for integration with ZF3.

Below, you can find the list of components together with their Composer-installable package names 
and brief descriptions:

  * `Doctrine\MongoDB` is Doctrine MongoDB Abstraction Layer. Its Composer-installable package name is 
   `doctrine/mongodb`.
  
  * `Doctrine\MongodbODM` (Object Document Mapper) provides a way to map NoSQL documents to PHP 
    entity models. Its Composer-installable package name is `doctrine/mongodb-odm`.

  * `Doctrine\MongoODMModule` is Zend Framework 3 Module that provides Doctrine MongoDB ODM 
    functionality. It serves for easy integration with ZF3. Its Composer-installable package name is 
    `doctrine/doctrine-mongo-odm-module`.
	
  * `Doctrine\CouchDB` component provides Simple API that wraps around CouchDBs HTTP API. Its Composer-installable
    package name is `doctrine/couchdb`.
	
  * `Doctrine\CouchdbODM` component is CouchDB Document Object Mapper. It is analogous to Doctrine ORM in sence
    that it provides the way to access database in object oriented way. Its Composer-installable
    package name is `doctrine/couchdb-odm`.
	
  * `Doctrine\OrientdbODM` is a set of PHP libraries in order to use OrientDB from PHP. Its Composer-installable
    package name is `doctrine/orientdb-odm`.
	
  * `Doctrine\PhpcrODM` is Object-Document-Mapper for PHPCR. Its Composer-installable
    package name is `doctrine/phpcr-odm`.

## Summary

In this appendix, we've provided the overview of Doctrine library architecture and components. Doctrine
is a large project consisting of multiple components mainly targeted on data persistence. 

On the market, there are two big groups of database management systems: traditional relational databases
and so called NoSQL databases. Although most relational databases use SQL language for querying and manipulating
data, each particular database system has its own specific features. The same thing can be seen with NoSQL
databases, where each system provides its own custom method for accessing data. Doctrine is designed to work with
data in database-agnostic way by providing sophisticated abstraction layers.

The most useful component of Doctrine, Object Relational Mapper (ORM) is designed to let the developer
an ability to work with data in object oriented way. This is when instead of writing an SQL query, you
load an entity object (or an array of entity objects) from a repository. With this approach, a database
table is mapped to a PHP class (also called an entity), and a row from that table is mapped to an 
instance of that entity class.
