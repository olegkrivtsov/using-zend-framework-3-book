# Creating a New Module {#modules}

When your website grows in size, you can benefit from using Zend Framework 3 feature called *modules*.
Modular applications consist of pieces that have relatively few dependencies on each other. This allows
to install or remove modules on demand. In this chapter you will learn what is a ZF3 module, when 
to create a new module and how to create it.

## When to Create a New Module?

A module is an *autonomous* and *reusable* unit of your application. By default your application has 
the single *Application* module. And it is normal to put your models, views and controllers in 
this module, especially in a simple website.

I> A module can contain models, views, controllers and assets. Module classes typically live in a separate
I> namespace (the same as module name). Module has its own configuration file where you can register routes,
I> controllers, controller plugins, services, view helpers and so on.

You may need to create a new module when any of the following is true:

  * If your website is relatively large and dividing it into pieces would make it easier to maintain.
    For example, you can introduce the *Admin* module and put your backend functionality into that module. 
  * If the functionality you are implementing is autonomous (has no or few dependencies on other 
    modules of your application. For example, the Blog functionality in theory can be 
    separated in another module, because it does not depend on the rest of the application, but 
    the application depends on it.
  * If a module can be separated from your application and concurrently used in another project. 
    For example the Blog module can be reused in another project without changes (only 
    its configuration may require changes).

In any case, real life is complex, and you should be guided by the intuition when it seems that it 
is necessary to create a new module. If you think that separating a functionality into a module gives 
you some significant benefits, create the module.

At the same time, you should not create a huge number of almost empty modules, it 
is better to combine related functionality in a single module.

## How to Create a New Module?

There are at least two ways of creating a new module in your website. The first way is copying an existing
module from *APP_DIR/module* directory (such as *Application* module), removing any unnecessary controllers,
models and views, and renaming the existing namespace into your module name in every source file. This may be rather
boring.

The second way is downloading an empty *skeleton module* from the official Zend Framework repository on GitHub.
You can find this repository by [this link](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonModule).
You can clone the code or download the code as a ZIP archive (recommended).

For example, in Linux, use the following commands to download the skeleton module:

~~~
cd ~
wget https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonModule/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cp ZendSkeletonModule-master APP_DIR/module/ZendSkeletonModule
~~~

The commands above download the source of the skeleton module to your home directory, unpack the archive
and copy the files to your website's `module` directory.

Let's look at the structure of the skeleton module (see figure 14.1):

![Figure 14.1. Skeleton module directory structure](images/modules/skeleton_module_directory.png)   

As you can see, we have a typical directory structure we are already familiar with:
 
  * `config` subdirectory contains `module.config.php` file which is the configuration file for this module.
  * `src` subdirectory is a directory containing module's source files:
    * `Controller` subdirectory contains a sample controller class.
    * `Module.php` file is the module entry point. We will discuss it a bit later.
  * `tests` subdirectory contains a stub for unit tests for this module. We do not cover unit tests in this book for simplicity.
  * `view` subdirectory contains view scripts (and also may contain module-specific layout templates).

### Renaming the Skeleton Module

Before you can use this new empty module, you should choose a name for it. A good name describes the module well.
For example, the name `Admin` is good when you need a module for backend stuff. `Blog` name would be good if you
plan to store blog functionality in this module. A good practice is also prepending some vendor name to the module
name, for example `YourCompanyBlog`.

Once you have chosen the name for the module, you should rename the directory containing module files. For example,
the command below will rename the module into `Admin`:

~~~
mv ZendSkeletonModule Admin
~~~

Next, you should rename the `SkeletonController.php` into something more descriptive. Don't forget to rename subdirectories
of `view` directory to reflect the name of the controller.

Finally, walk through configuration and source files of the controller and make sure you renamed the namespace `ZendSkeletonModule`
to the name of your module (this is required to ensure your classes will be found by PHP class autoloader).

### Enabling Class Autoloading

The last step is to enable PHP class autoloading. Our module source files will be organised to conform to PSR-4 standard, so we will
be able to use standard autoloader provided by Composer. To do that, add the following line into your
`composer.json` file under the `psr-4` key (substitute your module name):

~~~
...
"autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            ...
            "Admin\\": "module/Admin/src/"
        }
    },
...
~~~

Next run the following command to update Composer autloader files:

~~~
php composer.phar dump-autoload
~~~

I> The `dump-autoload` command just regenerates autoloader code without installing or updating any dependencies.

Great! The module is now ready for use. You can add controllers, models and views into it. Do not forget to
modify the `module.config.php` file and register your routes, services, controllers, controller plugins, view helpers, etc.

### Enabling the Module

To let ZF3 know about the new module and let it load it on app start up, do not forget to enable your new module in your 
*APP_DIR/config/modules.config.php* file as follows:

~~~
return [
    'Admin',
    //...
);
~~~

## Module.php File & Event Listening

The `Module.php` file located inside of module's source directory is some kind of module *entry point*.
The `Module` class defined in this file is loaded by `Zend\ModuleManager` component when it loads all application 
modules. 

One useful thing you can do with this class is *registering to events*. If you remember from the [Website Operation](#operation)
chapter, the application has several life stages represented by events. You may write an event listener function (or class) and
register it in your module entry point. When an event is triggered, your listener method (or class) will be called allowing you to
do something useful.

Q> **Why would I want to register an event listener?**
Q>
Q> Here are several practical applications of event listening that you may find useful:
Q>  
Q>   * Listen to *Route* event to force the use of HTTPS secure connection.
Q>   * When your website is in maintenance mode, listen to *Route* event to catch all requests and redirect user to the single page.
Q>   * Listen to *Dispatch* event to redirect a user to a different page. For example, if user is not authenticated, redirect him to the login page.
Q>   * Listen to *Dispatch* event to override the default layout template for all controllers belonging to the module.
Q>   * Listen to *Dispatch Error* event to log and/or report any exception or error happening in your website.
Q>   * Listen to *Render* event to modify the content of the resulting web page.  

There are two ways to register an event listener within the `Module` class: either with the help of `Module`'s `init()` method or with the
help of its `onBootstrap()` method. The difference between `init()` method and `onBootstrap()` method is that the `init()` method is called
earlier than `onBootstrap()`, before all other modules are initialized; while `onBootstrap()` is called once all modules are initialized.
In the following examples, we use `init()` method. 

### Example 1. Switching Layout Template

To show you how to subscribe to an event, let's create an event listener that will react on *Dispatch* event and
set a different layout template for *all* controllers of the module:

{line-numbers=on,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
namespace YourCompanyModule;

use Zend\ModuleManager\ModuleManager;
use Zend\Mvc\MvcEvent;

class Module
{
    // The "init" method is called on application start-up and 
    // allows to register an event listener.
    public function init(ModuleManager $manager)
    {
        // Get event manager.
        $eventManager = $manager->getEventManager();
        $sharedEventManager = $eventManager->getSharedManager();
        // Register the event listener method. 
        $sharedEventManager->attach(__NAMESPACE__, 'dispatch', 
                                    [$this, 'onDispatch'], 100);
    }
    
    // Event listener method.
    public function onDispatch(MvcEvent $event)
    {
        // Get controller to which the HTTP request was dispatched.
        $controller = $event->getTarget();
        // Get fully qualified class name of the controller.
        $controllerClass = get_class($controller);
        // Get module name of the controller.
        $moduleNamespace = substr($controllerClass, 0, strpos($controllerClass, '\\'));
           
        // Switch layout only for controllers belonging to our module.
        if ($moduleNamespace == __NAMESPACE__) {
            $viewModel = $event->getViewModel();
            $viewModel->setTemplate('layout/layout2');  
        }        
    }
    
    // ...
}
~~~

In the code above, we add the `init()` method to the `Module` class. In that method, we register an event listener (line 17)
with the help of `attach()` method provided by the `Zend\EventManager\SharedEventManager` class. The `attach()` method
takes four arguments: the ID of the emitting component, the event name ("dispatch"), the event listener method (the `onDispatch()` 
method of the current class), and the priority (100)).

The `onDispatch()` method is called on the Dispatch event. In this method, we check (line 32) if the HTTP request is
dispatched to the controller belonging to our module, and if so, switch the layout template (line 34).

### Example 2. Forcing the Use of HTTPS

In this example, we will show how to register an event listener that makes the website to always use HTTPS connection
with all of your web pages:

{line-numbers=on,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
namespace YourCompanyModule;

use Zend\ModuleManager\ModuleManager;
use Zend\Mvc\MvcEvent;

class Module
{
    // The "init" method is called on application start-up and 
    // allows to register an event listener.
    public function init(ModuleManager $manager)
    {
        // Get event manager.
        $eventManager = $manager->getEventManager();
        $sharedEventManager = $eventManager->getSharedManager();
        // Register the event listener method. 
        $sharedEventManager->attach(__NAMESPACE__, 'route', 
                                    [$this, 'onRoute'], 100);
    }
    
    // Event listener method.
    public function onRoute(MvcEvent $event)
    {
        if (php_sapi_name() == "cli") {
            // Do not execute HTTPS redirect in console mode.
            return;
        }
        
        // Get request URI
        $uri = $event->getRequest()->getUri();
        $scheme = $uri->getScheme();
        // If scheme is not HTTPS, redirect to the same URI, but with
        // HTTPS scheme.
        if ($scheme != 'https'){
            $uri->setScheme('https');
            $response=$event->getResponse();
            $response->getHeaders()->addHeaderLine('Location', $uri);
            $response->setStatusCode(301);
            $response->sendHeaders();
            return $response;
        }
    }
    
    // ...
}
~~~

In the code above, we register an event listener method that is called on *Route* event.

Inside the listener, we first check if our website is working in console mode. We do not
redirect HTTPS if in console mode.

Then, we extract the URI from the HTTP request and check if the current scheme is HTTPS or not.
If the scheme is not HTTPS, we redirect the user to the same URL, but with HTTPS scheme.

### Example 3. Reporting All Exceptions in Your Website

With this technique, you can easily track all exceptions happending in your website. Reporting
exceptions and errors is an important thing, because it allows to make your website more stable, 
secure and improve user experience.

{line-numbers=on,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
namespace YourCompanyModule;

use Zend\ModuleManager\ModuleManager;
use Zend\Mvc\MvcEvent;

class Module
{
    // The "init" method is called on application start-up and 
    // allows to register an event listener.
    public function init(ModuleManager $manager)
    {
        // Get event manager.
        $eventManager = $manager->getEventManager();
        $sharedEventManager = $eventManager->getSharedManager();
        // Register the event listener method. 
        $sharedEventManager->attach(__NAMESPACE__, MvcEvent::EVENT_DISPATCH_ERROR,
                                    [$this, 'onError'], 100);
        $sharedEventManager->attach(__NAMESPACE__, MvcEvent::EVENT_RENDER_ERROR, 
                                    [$this, 'onError'], 100);
    }
    
    // Event listener method.
    public function onError(MvcEvent $event)
    {
        // Get the exception information.
        $exception = $event->getParam('exception');
        if ($exception!=null) {
            $exceptionName = $exception->getMessage();
            $file = $exception->getFile();
            $line = $exception->getLine();
            $stackTrace = $exception->getTraceAsString();
        }
        $errorMessage = $event->getError();
        $controllerName = $event->getController();
        
        // Prepare email message.
        $to = 'admin@yourdomain.com';
        $subject = 'Your Website Exception';
        
        $body = '';
        if(isset($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'])) {
            $body .= "Request URI: " . $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] . "\n\n";
        }
        $body .= "Controller: $controllerName\n";
        $body .= "Error message: $errorMessage\n";
        if ($exception!=null) {
            $body .= "Exception: $exceptionName\n";
            $body .= "File: $file\n";
            $body .= "Line: $line\n";
            $body .= "Stack trace:\n\n" . $stackTrace;
        }
        
        $body = str_replace("\n", "<br>", $body);
        
        // Send an email about the error.
        mail($to, $subject, $body);
    }
    
    // ...
}
~~~ 

In the code above, we register an event listener that will be called on every Dispatch Error 
(route mismatch or an exception) and Rendrer Error. Inside the `onError()` listener method,
we extract some information about the exception/error and send it as an email message to the
address of your choice.

## Registering the Module as a Composer Package 

If you are writing a reusable module that you plan to make publicly available, you may want to publish the code of your module
on GitHub and register it on [Packagist.org](http://packagist.org) catalogue as a Composer-installable package.
This is absolutely free.

After you register the package, you will be able to add it as a dependency to your web application as follows (replace the `vendor`
and `package` placeholders with your company and package names, respectively):

~~~
php composer.phar require vendor/package
~~~
  
Composer will download and install your module to the `vendor` directory, so you will be able to use it as any third-party
module.  
  
## Summary

In this chapter, you have learned of the concept *modules* in Zend Framework 3. A module is an *autonomous* and 
*reusable* unit of your application. You may create a new module when your website becomes large and when the functionality
has very few dependencies on other parts of your application. 

Every ZF3 module has an entry point class called `Module`. You may use that class to register an event listener.
Event listeners are useful, for example, when you want to tweak change the default layout template for the entire module,
or to tweak the default content of a web page.

If you are developing a module that you want to make publicly available for use in other projects, you can register
your module on Packagist.org catalogue and install it with Composer as a third-party package.
