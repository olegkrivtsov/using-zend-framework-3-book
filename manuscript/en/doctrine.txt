# Database Management with Doctrine ORM {#doctrine}

Doctrine is an open-source PHP library providing convenient methods for managing your database in an
object-oriented way. For working with relational databases, Doctrine provides a component named *Object
Relational Mapper* (ORM for short). With Doctrine ORM you map your database table to a PHP class (in terms of Domain 
Driven Design, it is also called an *entity* class) and a row from that table is mapped to an 
instance of the entity class. If you are new to Doctrine, it is recommended that you also refer to 
[Appendix D. Introduction to Doctrine](#doctrine-intro) for introductory information about the Doctrine library architecture.

I> Doctrine is a third-party library, it is not part of Zend Framework 3. We cover it in this book
I> because it provides an easy way of adding database support to your ZF3-based web application.

## Get Blog Example from GitHub

For demonstration of Doctrine ORM usage, in this chapter, we will create a real-life *Blog* website. 
Its main features are the following:

  * It will store blog posts in a database and provide a user interface for accessing and managing those posts. 
  * It is assumed that the blog has the single author of its posts, while comments can be added
    by multiple blog readers.
  * The website will have two pages: *Home* page and *Admin* page. The first one will display the list
    of recently added posts, while the latter one will allow to add, edit, view and delete posts.
  
For example screen shots of the *Blog* website, please look at the figures 12.1 and 12.2 below:

![Figure 12.1. Blog home page](images/doctrine/blog_home_page.png)  

![Figure 12.2. Blog admin page](images/doctrine/blog_admin_page.png) 

To download the *Blog* application, visit [this page](https://github.com/olegkrivtsov/using-zf3-book-samples)
and click the *Clone or Download* button to download the code as a ZIP archive. 
When download is complete, unpack the archive to some directory.

Then navigate to the `blog` directory containing the 
source code of the *Blog* web application:

{line-numbers=off,lang=text}
~~~
/using-zf3-book-samples
  /blog
  ...
~~~

The *Blog* is a sample website which can be installed on your machine.
To install the sample, you can either edit your default Apache virtual host file
or create a new one. After editing the file, restart the Apache HTTP Server
and open the website in your web browser.

T> For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the *README.md* file located
   in the *blog* directory.

I> For the *Blog* sample to work, you have to create a MySQL database. Instructions on how to do
   that are provided in the next section.  

## Creating a Simple MySQL Database

For the *Blog* sample to work, we need to have a database. In this book, we use MySQL database 
management system, which is very simple in installation and administration. 

T> For OS-specific instructions on how to install MySQL server and client, please refer to 
   [Appendix A. Configuring Web Development Environment](#devenv).
  
Once you install MySQL, type the following command from your command shell to log into MySQL client 
console:

`mysql -u root -p`

When asked for, type the password of the *root* user (the password of the *root* user is 
the one you've specified during MySQL server installation). On successful login, you should 
see the following welcome message:

{line-numbers=off,lang=text}
~~~
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 4
Server version: 5.7.13-0ubuntu0.16.04.2 (Ubuntu)

Copyright (c) 2000, 2016, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.

Oracle is a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation and/or its
affiliates. Other names may be trademarks of their respective
owners.

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql>
~~~

Now you are able to type MySQL client commands (like `show databases`, `show tables`, etc.) or 
SQL queries (like `SELECT` or `INSERT`) at the MySQL prompt  and see their output. 

I> If you want to quit of the MySQL prompt, type `quit` and press Enter.

### Creating New Database

Let's create a database and name it `blog`. To do that, type the following SQL statement and 
press Enter:

{line-numbers=off,lang=text}
~~~
CREATE DATABASE blog;
~~~

The expected output of this command is the following:

`Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)`

T> MySQL commands are case insensitive, so you could type `create database blog;` with the same result.
   We recommend using upper case for SQL queries, since this is a common convention.

Next, we create the user named `blog` and grant it all privileges for accessing and modifying the 
`blog` database and all its tables:

{line-numbers=off,lang=text}
~~~
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON blog.* TO blog@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '<passwd>';
~~~

In the command above, replace the password placeholder with the new password for the `blog` user.
This password should be different than the password of the *root* user.

I> Here, we create the second user `blog`, because it is not recommended to give the web application 
I> ability to log into database under the `root` user. The *root* user has unlimited rights and it is
I> poor security practice to give an application the ability to do any actions it wants. The `blog` user will 
I> have permissions to modify the `blog` database only, which is sufficient in our case. 

You can check that the database has been created by typing the following command and pressing Enter:

`show databases;`

You should be able to see the output like below (note the `blog` line in the list of databases):

{line-numbers=off,lang=text}
~~~
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| blog               |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
+--------------------+
~~~

### Creating Tables

Next, we will create three tables typical for any simple blog: the `post` table will contain posts,
the `comment` table will contain comments to posts, and, finally, the `tag` table will contain tags 
(a tag is some kind of a key word describing a blog post well).

Additionally, we will create the fourth auxiliary table `post_tag` that will be used to create 
many-to-many relationship between the `post` and the `tag` tables.

Make the `blog` database current by typing the following from MySQL command prompt:

`use blog;`

To create the `post` table, type the following SQL statement:

{line-numbers=off,lang=text}
~~~
CREATE TABLE `post` (     
  `id` int(11) PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `title` text NOT NULL,    
  `content` text NOT NULL,           
  `status` int(11) NOT NULL, 
  `date_created` datetime NOT NULL
);
~~~

I> MySQL client allows easy entering of multi-line commands. Just press Enter when you want to move 
I> the caret to the next line. The command is considered to be fully entered when the semicolon (;)
I> character is encountered.

The expected output of this command is the following:

`Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.22 sec)`

Next, create the `comment` table by typing the following:

{line-numbers=off,lang=text}
~~~
CREATE TABLE `comment` (     
  `id` int(11) PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `post_id` int(11) NOT NULL,  
  `content` text NOT NULL,                
  `author` varchar(128) NOT NULL,   
  `date_created` datetime NOT NULL 
);
~~~

Then, create the `tag` table:

{line-numbers=off,lang=text}
~~~
CREATE TABLE `tag` (     
  `id` int(11) PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` VARCHAR(128)                     
);
~~~

And finally, create the `post_tag` table:

{line-numbers=off,lang=text}
~~~
CREATE TABLE `post_tag` (     
  `id` int(11) PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `post_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `tag_id` int(11) NOT NULL
);
~~~

Let's fill the tables we have created with some sample data:

{line-numbers=off, lang=text}
~~~
INSERT INTO tag(`name`) VALUES('ZF3');
INSERT INTO tag(`name`) VALUES('book');
INSERT INTO tag(`name`) VALUES('magento');
INSERT INTO tag(`name`) VALUES('bootstrap');

INSERT INTO post(`title`, `content`, `status`, `date_created`) VALUES(
   'A Free Book about Zend Framework',
   'I''m pleased to announce that now you can read my new book "Using Zend Framework 3" absolutely for free! Moreover, the book is an open-source project hosted on GitHub, so you are encouraged to contribute.', 
   2, '2016-08-09 18:49');

INSERT INTO post(`title`, `content`, `status`, `date_created`) VALUES(
   'Getting Started with Magento Extension Development - Book Review',
   'Recently, I needed some good resource to start learning Magento e-Commerce system for one of my current web projects. For this project, I was required to write an extension module that would implement a customer-specific payment method.', 
   2, '2016-08-10 18:51');

INSERT INTO post(`title`, `content`, `status`, `date_created`) VALUES(
   'Twitter Bootstrap - Making a Professionaly Looking Site',
   'Twitter Bootstrap (shortly, Bootstrap) is a popular CSS framework allowing to make your website professionally looking and visually appealing, even if you don''t have advanced designer skills.', 
   2, '2016-08-11 13:01');

INSERT INTO post_tag(`post_id`, `tag_id`) VALUES(1, 1);
INSERT INTO post_tag(`post_id`, `tag_id`) VALUES(1, 2);
INSERT INTO post_tag(`post_id`, `tag_id`) VALUES(2, 2);
INSERT INTO post_tag(`post_id`, `tag_id`) VALUES(2, 3);
INSERT INTO post_tag(`post_id`, `tag_id`) VALUES(3, 4);

INSERT INTO comment(`post_id`, `content`, `author`, `date_created`) VALUES(
    1, 'Excellent post!', 'Oleg Krivtsov', '2016-08-09 19:20');
~~~

I> If necessary, you can easily remove the database and all tables and data it contains by typing the 
I> following command from MySQL prompt:
I>
I> `DROP DATABASE blog;`

Figure 12.3 graphically illustrates what entities we have in the database and what relationships between 
those entities present.

![Figure 12.3. Graphical representation of database schema](images/doctrine/database_schema.png)

As you can see from figure 12.3, the `post` table is related to `comment` table as *one-to-many*, 
because a single post may have many comments. This is also called the "one-to-many" relationship.

The `post` table is also related to the `tag` table as *many-to-many*. A single post may have many tags,
and a single tag may belong to many posts as well. Many-to-many relationship is typically implemented 
through an auxiliary table (`post_tag` table in our case).

### Importing Ready Database Schema

In the previous section, we've shown how to create the complete database schema that is used in the 
*Blog* sample web application. In the real life, you typically do not type all those SQL
statements at the MySQL prompt. Instead, you could type the `CREATE TABLE` statements to a file and save 
it to disk. Then you could just import that file and have the ready schema. 

For your convenience, the ready schema for *Blog* sample can be found in *APP_DIR/data/schema.mysql.sql* 
file. The file is a plain text file containing SQL statements. To import the file, go to the *APP_DIR/data/* 
directory and type the following command from your command shell (but not from MySQL prompt):

`mysql -u root -p blog < schema.mysql.sql`

When prompted for password, enter the password of the root user and press Enter.

Once this is done, log into the MySQL client and type the following commands:

{line-numbers=off,lang=text}
~~~
use blog;

show tables;
~~~

You should see the list of tables created, something like below:  

{line-numbers=off,lang=text}
~~~
+----------------+
| Tables_in_blog |
+----------------+
| comment        |
| post           |
| post_tag       |
| tag            |
+----------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
~~~

T> Also consider using *database migrations* for initializing database schema. For additional
T> info about migrations, please refer to [Database Migrations](#migrations) chapter.  
  
## Integrating Doctrine ORM with Zend Framework 3

For easy integration with Zend Framework 3, Doctrine project provides the following two components
(that are actually ZF3 modules):
  
  * [DoctrineModule](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineORMModule) is a ZF3 module that 
    provides Doctrine basic functionality required by the ORM component;

  * [DoctrineORMModule](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineORMModule) integrates Doctrine Object Relational Mapper (ORM)
    with Zend Framework 3.
    
Each of the above Doctrine components is distributed as a Composer-installable package and is registered in 
[Packagist.org](https://packagist.org/) catalogue. This is very similar to the way that Zend Framework 3 
uses for installing its components.

Since Composer packages may depend on each other, it is enough to declare dependency only on *DoctrineORMModule*.
This package depends on *DoctrineModule* and on some other Doctrine components (*Doctrine\\ORM*, 
*Doctrine\\DBAL*, *Doctrine\\Common*, *Doctrine\\Annotations*, etc.). So, when you install this 
component, Composer will install other required components automatically.

### Installing Doctrine Components with Composer
	
In order to install required Doctrine components, we first *add a dependency* to the *composer.json* file
located in the root directory of the web application (in this book, we typically denote that directory 
as *APP_DIR*). 

To add the dependency, type the following commands from your command shell (replace the *APP_DIR* 
placeholder with the actual directory name of your application):

`cd APP_DIR`

`php composer.phar require doctrine/doctrine-orm-module`

The `cd` command above is used to make the *APP_DIR* directory current working directory. 

And the `require` command tells Composer to add the package `doctrine/doctrine-orm-module` as a 
dependency to your web application, and to download and install that dependency. 

Once you run the commands above, Composer will first modify the *composer.json* file and create the 
line like below under its `require` key:

{line-numbers=off,lang=json}
~~~
{
  ...  
  "require": {    
    "doctrine/doctrine-orm-module": "^1.0.9",    
    ...
  },
  ...  
}
~~~

Then Composer will try to locate the dependency packages, download them to the local machine and
install the files into the *APP_DIR/vendor* directory.

Composer will output lines indicating installation process to the terminal. As you can see from the Composer 
output, when you install `DoctrineORMModule` component, Composer 
automatically installs the `DoctrineModule` and all necessary Doctrine components (*Doctrine\\DBAL*, 
*Doctrine\\ORM*, etc.)

I> As a bonus, at the end of installation, Composer "suggests" you to install some additional packages
I> that might be useful for you (`doctrine/migrations`, `doctrine/data-fixtures`, etc.) If you strongly
I> wish, you may add those dependencies with the Composer's `require` command as well.

When the installation has been finished, you can find the Doctrine files in your *APP_DIR/vendor* 
directory (see the figure 12.4 below). 
   
![Figure 12.4. Doctrine files are installed to vendor directory](images/doctrine/installed_doctrine_files.png)

T> You use the `php composer.phar require` command for the first time you install Doctrine. Once the
T> *composer.json* (and *composer.lock*) files have been modified by Composer, you are able to install (or update) 
T> all dependencies as usual by typing the `php composer.phar install` or `php composer.phar update`
T> commands, respectively, from your command shell.

### Loading Doctrine Integration Modules on Application Start Up

Once you have installed the *DoctrineORMModule* and all its dependencies, you need to add 
the following lines to your *APP_DIR/config/modules.config.php* file to enable the modules:

{line-numbers=on,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
return [
    // Add the Doctrine integration modules.
    'DoctrineModule',
    'DoctrineORMModule',      
    //...
);
~~~

The lines above let ZF3 know that it should load the *DoctrineModule* module and *DoctrineORMModule* 
module on application start up.
  
### Doctrine Configuration Overview
   
To use Doctrine with your ZF3-based web application, you have to provide its configuration. 
The configuration tells Doctrine what databases present, how to connect to a database (what database 
driver, host, user name and password to use), where to locate entity classes and how to extract their 
annotations (metadata), how to store cached data (in the file system or to use a caching extension), 
and so on. This section's goal is to give you a general idea of how Doctrine configuration
looks like. 

The default Doctrine configuration is located in the *module.config.php* config file of the 
*DoctrineORMModule*. Look at the figure 12.5 below to have an idea of how the Doctrine config 
"tree" may look like [^doctrine_config]. You may also refer to the *module.config.php* file of 
*DoctrineORMModule* for the same reason.

![Figure 12.5. Graphical representation of Doctrine configuration "tree"](images/doctrine/doctrine_config_tree.png)	

[^doctrine_config]: The tree in figure 12.5 may be different than you have in your own application, 
                    because some keys were omitted here for simplicity.							

As you can see from the figure 12.5, there is the top-level key named `doctrine`. Under that key,
there is a number of subkeys containing the following settings:

  * the `connection` key contains the list of all databases that the web application is able to connect to. 
    For each database connection it contains parameters like driver class name, host, user name, 
	password and database name. 
	
I> By default, there is only one connection named `orm_default`, and you may add more database connections if required.
  
  * the `configuration` key contains ORM settings like caching configuration and locations of 
    auto-generated entity proxy classes for each available connection.
  
  * the `driver` key contains the information about where to locate entity classes for each available 
    database connection. 

  * the `entitymanager` key contains settings used for instantiating an entity manager for each database 
    connection.
  
  * the `eventmanager` key contains settings for Doctrine event manager for each available connection.
  
I> Doctrine uses its own implementation of event manager. If you want, you can create an event listener
I> class and hooks some events. However, this is an advanced topic and we do not cover it in this book.
  
  * the `migrations_configuration` key contains settings for database migrations. Database migrations
    are used for initializing and updating database schema in a standard and consistent way. 
		
### Overriding the Default Doctrine Configuration	
   
As you already know from [Website Operation](#operation) chapter, in a ZF3-based web application configuration is 
typically divided into two categories: application-wide configuration and module-specific configuration. 

  * For storing application-wide Doctrine settings, you typically use the *APP_DIR/config/autoload/global.php* or 
    *APP_DIR/config/autoload/local.php* config files. The first one suits well for storing 
	settings not depending on particular environment, while the latter one 
	suits well for storing environment-dependent settings (like database connection parameters).

  * For storing Doctrine settings specific to certain module, you use the *module.config.php* config
    file located inside the *config* directory of that module. This is suitable, for example, 
	for storing the entity location settings.

When ZF3-based website loads its configuration, it merges all configs into a single big array, thus 
forming the final Doctrine config "tree".

I> By adding your application-specific Doctrine configuration, you extend and/or override the 
I> default configuration tree provided by the *DoctrineORMModule*.

## Specifying Database Connection Parameters

Below we provide content of the *autoload/local.php* file of the *Blog* web application.
This config file contains the application-wide database connection settings for the `blog` 
MySQL database that we created earlier in this chapter:

I> This connection is shared between all modules of the web application. If you want to create
I> module-specific connection, consider adding the key to the *module.config.php* file instead.

{line-numbers=on,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
use Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\PDOMySql\Driver as PDOMySqlDriver;

return [
    'doctrine' => [
        'connection' => [
            'orm_default' => [
                'driverClass' => PDOMySqlDriver::class,
                'params' => [
                    'host'     => '127.0.0.1',                    
                    'user'     => 'blog',
                    'password' => '<password>',
                    'dbname'   => 'blog',
                ]
            ],            
        ],        
    ],
];
~~~

Above, we have the `doctrine` key and `connection` subkey. The `connection` subkey contains the 
`orm_default` subkey which is the default connection.

  * The `driverClass` key provides the class name to use as a driver to the database. Since we use MySQL
    database, we specify the `Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\PDOMySql\Driver` class name. 

T> For your reference, in table 12.1, you can find several other often used database drivers.
   Each driver class supports its own set of parameters, so please refer to certain driver's code (and
   related documentation) for additional information.

  * The `params` key contains the connection parameters:

    * `host` may be either the domain name or IP address of the database server;
    * `user` is the MySQL user name with granted permissions to the database;
    * `password` is the secret word for the user name;
    * `dbname` is the name of the database.

{title="Table 12.1. Often Used Database Driver Classes"}

| *Method*                           | *Description*                                      |

|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|

I> Because the *autoload/local.php* file contains environment-specific parameters, 
I> you only store its "distribution template", *local.php.dist* file, in version control.
I> Each developer in your team then renames the *local.php.dist* file to *local.php* and
I> enters his own password instead of the placeholder. The *local.php* file should not be version
I> controlled, because you you usually do not want other people on your team (or other people having
I> access to your code repository) seeing the actual password.  

Q> **What happens if I need several database connections?**
Q>
Q> You can easily add more database connections by adding other keys below the `orm_default` key.
Q> For example, let's assume that you have another database for testing purposes. To let
Q> Doctrine know about this database, you create the `orm_test` subkey below the `orm_default` key
Q> and fill it with connection parameters.

## About Doctrine Entities

An *entity* is a PHP class that is designed for storing data. For example, below you can find 
several oftenly used examples of entities:

  * `User` entity is designed to store information about a website visitor. It may contain 
     properties like username, password, first name, last name, etc.
	 
  * `License` entity is designed to store information about a software license. It may contain data
    like unique license key, reference to user who purchased the license, license creation date, etc.
	
  * `Payment` entity may contain properties related to a purchase of some goods. The properties are:
    transaction ID, money amount, money currency, etc.	 

I> In terms of Domain Driven Design pattern, entities are a kind of models designed for storing data.
   For additional examples of entities and other types of models, please refer to [Model-View-Controller](#mvc).

In Doctrine ORM, an entity class is mapped on a certain database table. For example, the `User` entity
is usually mapped on the `user` table (if needed, the table name may be arbitrary). 

For our *Blog* example application, we will create three entity classes:

  * `Post` entity will contain data related to specific blog post. Its properties are exactly the
    same that we used when defining the `post` table in `blog` database schema. The entity class will
    also have public getter and setter methods designed for retrieving/setting the data.	
	
  * by analogy, `Comment` entity will contain data related to a comment to blog post.
  
  * and `Tag` entity will contain data related to a tag.

### Annotations

An *annotation* is a special kind of a PHP comment that is preprocessed by Doctrine ORM.
In other words, annotations is metadata attached to an entity class that can be read by the Doctrine 
ORM at run-time. Annotations provide verbose information about an entity. Annotations describe an 
entity and tell Doctrine ORM how to map it on a database table. 

A Docblock annotation is a C++ style comment starting with slash (/) and two asterisks (*). 
This "starter" characters are required, otherwise Doctrine won't recognize the annotation.
An example of annotation can be found below:
   
{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
/**
 * This is Docblock annotation comment.
 */
~~~

Doctrine reads Docblock annotations with the help of its `Doctrine\Annotations` component.

T> You might have already seen Docblock annotations if you've used [phpDocumentor](http://www.phpdoc.org/) or 
T> [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) documentation generation
T> tools. In those tools, annotation comments are serving the same goal: to describe a PHP class and 
T> its properties and methods. Then the tool goes through your code and builds HTML documentation
T> automatically based entirely on code and annotations analysis.

For example, below, we provide the basic example of a Doctrine entity class. You can see that the class and its
properties are marked with Docblock annotations with special *tags* (a tag starts with '@' character). 

{line-numbers=on,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
namespace Application\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 * @ORM\Table(name="post")
 */
class Post 
{
  /**
   * @ORM\Id
   * @ORM\GeneratedValue
   * @ORM\Column(name="id")   
   */
  protected $id;

  /** 
   * @ORM\Column(name="title")  
   */
  protected $title;

  /** 
   * @ORM\Column(name="content")  
   */
  protected $content;

  /** 
   * @ORM\Column(name="status")  
   */
  protected $status;

  /**
   * @ORM\Column(name="date_created")  
   */
  protected $dateCreated;   
}
~~~

Let's review the code above:

In line 2, we declared the `Application\Entity` namespace in which entity classes for the *Application*
module live.

In line 4, you may notice that we use the `Doctrine\ORM\Mapping` class and its short `ORM` 
alias for Doctrine annotations [^annotation_namespaces].

[^annotation_namespaces]: Doctrine-provided annotation tags are implemented as classes living 
                          inside of `Doctrine/ORM/Mapping` namespace. This is to avoid annotation 
						  naming collisions (assume the case when some other component has an 
						  annotation named `Entity` or `Table`, the collision would happen).
                          
In lines 6-9, you can see a Dockblock annotation for the `Post` class. Each annotation tag
begins with the `@` character, has the name and (optional) parameters enclosed into the round braces.

Doctrine-provided tags used in annotations may be of two types: class-level and property-level. In 
the code above, we use the following class-level tags (describing the whole entity class):

  * `@ORM\Entity` tag (line 7) declares that this class is a Doctrine ORM entity;
  
  * `@ORM\Table(name="post")` tag  (line 8) tells Doctrine ORM that this entity class 
    is mapped on the `post` database table;
  
Entity's properties are described with the following property-level tags:

  * `@ORM\Id` tells that this property is actually a unique identifier of the entity (see line 13);
  
  * `@ORM\GeneratedValue` is used to tell Doctrine ORM that this property uses some
     auto-generated sequence for initializing itself (line 14). In MySQL, this typically means that 
	 the corresponding table column uses `AUTO_INCREMENT` initializer.  
  
  * `@ORM\Column(name="<column_name>")` is used to tell Doctrine ORM on which table column to map
    this particular property (lines 15, 20, 25, 30, 35).

T> The complete list of Doctrine-provided tags used in annotations can be found by the following 
T> [link](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/annotations-reference.html).

## Creating Entities
  
For the *Application* module, entities are (by convention) stored inside the *Entity* 
directory under the module's source directory. Entity classes live inside the `Application\Entity` 
namespace.

### Adding Post Entity

We start with creating the `Post` entity. Create the *Post.php* file under module's *Entity* 
directory. (If you haven't created the *Entity* directory yet, its the right time to do that.) 
Put the following code into the file:

{line-numbers=on,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
namespace Application\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

/**
 * This class represents a single post in a blog.
 * @ORM\Entity
 * @ORM\Table(name="post")
 */
class Post 
{
  // Post status constants.
  const STATUS_DRAFT       = 1; // Draft.
  const STATUS_PUBLISHED   = 2; // Published.

  /**
   * @ORM\Id
   * @ORM\GeneratedValue
   * @ORM\Column(name="id")   
   */
  protected $id;

  /** 
   * @ORM\Column(name="title")  
   */
  protected $title;

  /** 
   * @ORM\Column(name="content")  
   */
  protected $content;

  /** 
   * @ORM\Column(name="status")  
   */
  protected $status;

  /**
   * @ORM\Column(name="date_created")  
   */
  protected $dateCreated;
  
  // Returns ID of this post.
  public function getId() 
  {
    return $this->id;
  }

  // Sets ID of this post.
  public function setId($id) 
  {
    $this->id = $id;
  }

  // Returns title.
  public function getTitle() 
  {
    return $this->title;
  }

  // Sets title.
  public function setTitle($title) 
  {
    $this->title = $title;
  }

  // Returns status.
  public function getStatus() 
  {
    return $this->status;
  }

  // Sets status.
  public function setStatus($status) 
  {
    $this->status = $status;
  }
    
  // Returns post content.
  public function getContent() 
  {
    return $this->content; 
  }
    
  // Sets post content.
  public function setContent($content) 
  {
    $this->content = $content;
  }
    
  // Returns the date when this post was created.
  public function getDateCreated() 
  {
    return $this->dateCreated;
  }
    
  // Sets the date when this post was created.
  public function setDateCreated($dateCreated) 
  {
    $this->dateCreated = $dateCreated;
  }
}
~~~

In the code above, we have the following things:

  * Status constants (lines 14 and 15). These constants conveniently represent possible values the 
    `$status` property may receive (1 for Draft, 2 for Published).  

  * Protected properties (`$title`, `$content`, `$dateCreated`, etc.). These are data
    that a typical blog post has (see table 12.2 below for reference of properties together with
	their brief descriptions). 
	  	
T> Please note that for properties we (by convention) use camel-case names (like `$dateCreated`), 
   while for database columns we use "canonicalized" names (in lower-case and with underscores 
   separating words in a name, like `date_created`).

{title="Table 12.2. Properties of the Post entity"}

  * Entity class and its properties are marked with Docblock annotations read by Doctrine ORM at
    run-time allowing it to know how to map this entity and its properties on the database table 
	and its columns. 	
	
  * Entity class has getter and setter methods (lines 45-102) allowing to access/modify the protected 
    properties (see the table 12.3 for reference of methods and their brief descriptions).

T> Note that we do not mark entity class methods with Doctrine annotations. There is just no need to
   do that. However, you may mark methods with usual comments and non-Doctrine Docblock annotations, 
   if you strongly wish.

### Adding the Comment and Tag Entities

By analogy with the `Post` entity, we next create the `Comment` and the `Tag` entity classes in
the *Entity* directory. To do that, first, create *Comment.php* file and put the
following code inside of it:

{line-numbers=on,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
namespace Application\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

/**
 * This class represents a comment related to a blog post.
 * @ORM\Entity
 * @ORM\Table(name="comment")
 */
class Comment 
{
  /**
   * @ORM\Id
   * @ORM\Column(name="id")
   * @ORM\GeneratedValue
   */
  protected $id;

  /** 
   * @ORM\Column(name="content")  
   */
  protected $content;

  /** 
   * @ORM\Column(name="author")  
   */
  protected $author;
    
  /** 
   * @ORM\Column(name="date_created")  
   */
  protected $dateCreated;

  // Returns ID of this comment.
  public function getId() 
  {
    return $this->id;
  }

  // Sets ID of this comment.
  public function setId($id) 
  {
    $this->id = $id;
  }
    
  // Returns comment text.
  public function getContent() 
  {
    return $this->content;
  }

  // Sets status.
  public function setContent($content) 
  {
    $this->content = $content;
  }
    
  // Returns author's name.
  public function getAuthor() 
  {
    return $this->author;
  }

  // Sets author's name.
  public function setAuthor($author) 
  {
    $this->author = $author;
  }

  // Returns the date when this comment was created.
  public function getDateCreated() 
  {
    return $this->dateCreated;
  }
    
  // Sets the date when this comment was created.
  public function setDateCreated($dateCreated) 
  {
    $this->dateCreated = $dateCreated;
  }
}
~~~  
   
Next, create *Tag.php* file and put the following code inside of it:   

{line-numbers=on,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
namespace Application\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

/**
 * This class represents a tag.
 * @ORM\Entity
 * @ORM\Table(name="tag")
 */
class Tag 
{
  /**
   * @ORM\Id
   * @ORM\GeneratedValue
   * @ORM\Column(name="id")
   */
  protected $id;

  /** 
   * @ORM\Column(name="name") 
   */
  protected $name;

  // Returns ID of this tag.
  public function getId() 
  {
    return $this->id;
  }

  // Sets ID of this tag.
  public function setId($id) 
  {
    $this->id = $id;
  }

  // Returns name.
  public function getName() 
  {
    return $this->name;
  }

  // Sets name.
  public function setName($name) 
  {
    $this->name = $name;
  }
}
~~~

Since the `Comment` and `Tag` entities are analogous to the `Post` entity, we don't provide detailed
description of the code above.

T> Please note that we do not create an entity for the fourth auxiliary table `post_tag`. That
   table will be indirectly used further in this chapter when defining relationships between entities.

### Specifying Relationships between Entities

Now its time to use annotations to define relationships between entities. If you remember,
we have two relationships between our entities:

  * the `Post` and `Comment` entities are related as "one-to-many";
  * and the `Post` and `Tag` entities are related as "many-to-many".
 
In Doctrine, to express a relationship between two entities, you add a private property paired 
with Docblock annotation.

T> For detailed information about relationships between entities in Doctrine, please read 
   [this page](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/association-mapping.html)
   of Doctrine documentation.

#### OneToMany/ManyToOne
   
First, let's define one-to-many relationship between the `Post` and `Comment` entities. Modify the *Post.php*
file and add the following lines:

{line-numbers=on,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
// ...
use Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection;
use Application\Entity\Comment;

/**
 * This class represents a single post in a blog.
 * @ORM\Entity
 * @ORM\Table(name="post")
 */
class Post 
{
  // ...  
  
  /**
   * @ORM\OneToMany(targetEntity="\Application\Entity\Comment", mappedBy="post")
   * @ORM\JoinColumn(name="id", referencedColumnName="post_id")
   */
  protected $comments;
    
  /**
   * Constructor.
   */
  public function __construct() 
  {
    $this->comments = new ArrayCollection();               
  }
    
  /**
   * Returns comments for this post.
   * @return array
   */
  public function getComments() 
  {
    return $this->comments;
  }
    
  /**
   * Adds a new comment to this post.
   * @param $comment
   */
  public function addComment($comment) 
  {
    $this->comments[] = $comment;
  }
}
~~~

As you can see from the code above, we added the `$comments` property (line 19). This
property will be the *collection* of comments related to certain post. 

We initialize the `$comments` property in class constructor (lines 24-27). By assigning it with
a new instance of `Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection` class.

T> A Doctrine `ArrayCollection` is an array of objects, like usual PHP `array`, but with additional
T> features required by Doctrine. It is implemented in *Doctrine\Common* component.
  
In lines 15-18, we add Doctrine annotations to the `$comments` property, so Doctrine knows how to 
get all comments associated with the post:

  * the `@ORM\OneToMany` tag defines that this is the one-to-many relationship between the `Post` entity and
    the (target) `Comment` entity.
  * the `@ORM\JoinColumn` tag specifies which column to use for joining the tables associated with the 
    entities.

The `getComments()` method (lines 33-36) allows to do get all comments associated with the post.
    
We also added the `addComment()` method (lines 42-45) for adding new comment to post. You can notice that
we use the `[]` operator, just like we do with a typical PHP array.
	
Vice versa, we define the other side of this relationship by modifying the `Comment` entity as follows:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
// ...
use Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection;

// ...
class Comment 
{
  /**
   * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="\Application\Entity\Post", inversedBy="comments")
   * @ORM\JoinColumn(name="post_id", referencedColumnName="id")
   */
  protected $post;
     
  /*
   * Returns associated post.
   * @return \Application\Entity\Post
   */
  public function getPost() 
  {
    return $this->post;
  }
    
  /**
   * Sets associated post.
   * @param \Application\Entity\Post $post
   */
  public function setPost($post) 
  {
    $this->post = $post;
    $post->addComment($this);
  }
}
~~~

In the code above, we added the `$post` private property to the entity class. This is not a collection,
but a single instance of `Post` class, because single comment always belongs to single post. 
The annotation tags `@ORM\ManyToOne` and `@ORM\JoinColumn` are analogous to those we covered before.

#### ManyToMany

Let's now express the many-to-many relationship between the `Post` and `Tag` entities. For this relationship,
we indirectly use the auxiliary `post_tag` table. 

Modify the `Post` entity as follows:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
//...
use Application\Entity\Tag;

//...
class Post 
{
  //...
    
  /**
   * @ORM\ManyToMany(targetEntity="\Application\Entity\Tag", inversedBy="posts")
   * @ORM\JoinTable(name="post_tag",
   *      joinColumns={@ORM\JoinColumn(name="post_id", referencedColumnName="id")},
   *      inverseJoinColumns={@ORM\JoinColumn(name="tag_id", referencedColumnName="id")}
   *      )
   */
  protected $tags;
    
  // Constructor.
  public function __construct() 
  { 
    //...  
    $this->tags = new ArrayCollection();        
  }

  // Returns tags for this post.
  public function getTags() 
  {
    return $this->tags;
  }      
    
  // Adds a new tag to this post.
  public function addTag($tag) 
  {
    $this->tags[] = $tag;        
  }
    
  // Removes association between this post and the given tag.
  public function removeTagAssociation($tag) 
  {
    $this->tags->removeElement($tag);
  }
}
~~~

In the code above, we do the following:

  * add `$tags` private property
  * mark the `$tags` property with Docblock annotations with `@ORM\ManyToMany` and `@ORM\JoinTable`
    annotation tags
  * initialize the property in constructor;
  * add three methods `getTags()`, `addTag()` and `removeTagAssociation()` allowing to get/modify the property's value.

Finally, modify the `Tag` entity as follows:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
//...
use Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection;

class Tag 
{
  // ...
  
  /**
   * @ORM\ManyToMany(targetEntity="\Application\Entity\Post", mappedBy="tags")
   */
  protected $posts;
    
  // Constructor.
  public function __construct() 
  {        
    $this->posts = new ArrayCollection();        
  }
  
  // Returns posts associated with this tag.
  public function getPosts() 
  {
    return $this->posts;
  }
    
  // Adds a post into collection of posts related to this tag.
  public function addPost($post) 
  {
    $this->posts[] = $post;        
  }
}
~~~ 
 
In the code above, we by analogy define the other side of the relationship and getter/setter methods for
retrieving the collection of posts associated with the tag, and adding posts associated with the given 
tag.   
   
### Specifying Entity Locations

To let Doctrine know where to find entities for your *Application* module (or for another module you 
have), you add the following lines into your *module.config.php* file:

{line-numbers=on,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
namespace Application;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping\Driver\AnnotationDriver;

return [
  // ...
  'doctrine' => [
        'driver' => [
            __NAMESPACE__ . '_driver' => [
                'class' => AnnotationDriver::class,
                'cache' => 'array',
                'paths' => [__DIR__ . '/../src/Entity']
            ],
            'orm_default' => [
                'drivers' => [
                    __NAMESPACE__ . '\Entity' => __NAMESPACE__ . '_driver'
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ]  
];
~~~

Above, in line 2, we specify the namespace `Application`. This should be the name of the current 
module. 

T> Note that usually we do not specify namespace in config files, but in this particular case it is 
   convenient to do. When we have namespace defined, we can use the `__NAMESPACE__` placeholder which
   expands into that namespace.

In line 8, we have `doctrine` key, under which we have the `driver` subkey.
In line 13, we tell Doctrine ORM that our entities are stored inside of *Entity* 
directory under the module's *src* directory.

## About Entity Manager

*Entity manager* is the primary access point to ORM functionality provided by Doctrine.

I> `EntityManager` is a Doctrine class that lives in `Doctrine\ORM` namespace and used to 
I> retrieve entities from their repositories using search criteria and save entities 
I> back to database. 

`EntityManager` is registered as a service in the Zend Framework 3 service manager.
In your factory class, you retrieve the `EntityManager` from service manager as
follows (if you need a different connection than `orm_default`, just replace the `orm_default` with
the required connection name):

{line-numbers=off, lang=php}
~~~
// Get Doctrine entity manager
$entityManager = $container->get('doctrine.entitymanager.orm_default');   
~~~

The most used methods provided by the `EntityManager` class are listed in table 12.4 below.

{title="Table 12.4. Methods of the EntityManager"}
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| *Method*                           | *Description*                                    |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `persist($entity)`                 | Places new entity into entity manager (makes it managed). |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `remove($entity)`                  | Removes an entity from database.      |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `flush()`                          | Flushes all changes to objects that have been queued up to now to the database. |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `createQuery($dql)`                | Creates a new Query object.                      |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `getRepository($entityName)`       | Gets the repository for an entity class.         |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|

Let's review the methods from table 12.4.

To add a newly created entity to entity manager (to make the entity "managed"), you use 
entity manager's `persist()` method.
To remove an entity from database, you use entity manager's `remove()` method. 

When you call `persist()` or `remove()`, `EntityManager` remembers your changes in memory, but doesn't
apply changes to database automatically (by performance reasons). To apply changes to database in a 
single transaction, you use the `flush()` method.

For example, look at the code example below that shows how to create an instance of the `Post` entity
and save it to database:

{line-numbers=off, lang=php}
~~~
// Create new Post entity.
$post = new Post();
$post->setTitle('Top 10+ Books about Zend Framework 3');
$post->setContent('Post body goes here');
$post->setStatus(Post::STATUS_PUBLISHED);
$currentDate = date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
$post->setDateCreated($currentDate);        

// Add the entity to entity manager.
$entityManager->persist($post);

// Apply changes to database.
$entityManager->flush();
~~~

The `createQuery()` method of the entity manager is designed for creating a query from a DQL string. It returns the `Query`
object. You then execute the query and get results (an array of entities matching search conditions).

The `getRepository()` method of the entity manager is designed to get repository by entity class name. Please look
below for example where we get the repository for our `Post` entity:

{line-numbers=off, lang=php}
~~~
$repository = $entityManager->getRepository(Post::class);
~~~

### Entity Repositories

Conceptually, each entity class has its own repository. The repository provides methods for retrieving
entities from database. The repository can be considered as a collection of all 
available entities of certain class. For example, there are repositories for our `Post`, `Comment`, 
and `Tag` entities.

To load data from the database, you retrieve an entity from its repository. When you request the repository for
an entity, it loads the data from the table mapped to the entity, and assigns
entity's fields with the data. 

I> The `Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository` class implements the default repository. If needed, you can,
I> by extending the `EntityRepository`, create your own repository for certain entity class. 
I> We will show how to do that later.

The most used methods provided by the `EntityRepository` class are listed in table 12.5.

{title="Table 12.5. Methods of the EntityRepository"}
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| *Method*                           | *Description*                                    |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `findAll()`                        | Finds all entities in the repository.            |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `find($id)`                        | Finds an entity by its identifier.               |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `findBy($criteria, $orderBy, $limit, $offset)` | Finds entities by a set of criteria. |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `findOneBy($criteria, $orderBy)`    | Finds a single entity by a set of criteria.     |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `createQueryBuilder($alias)`       | Creates a new QueryBuilder instance that is prepopulated for this entity name.      |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|

The `findAll()` method gets all entities from repository. For simple example of its usage, look below:

{line-numbers=off, lang=php}
~~~
// Find all posts from repository
$posts = $entityManager->getRepository(Post::class)->findAll();
~~~

The `find()` method is the simplest method of searching for an entity. It retrieves an entity
by its ID (primary key). 

In the example below, we select post with ID = 1.

{line-numbers=off, lang=php}
~~~
// Find post by primary key (ID)
$post = $entityManager->getRepository(Post::class)->find(1);
~~~

The `findBy()` takes a search criteria (and optional sorting order and limit)
arguments and returns a collection of entities matching criteria. The `findOneBy()` method is very
similar to `findBy()`, but it returns the first entity matching the criteria. 

In the code example below, we use the `findBy()` method for selecting 50 most recent published posts:

{line-numbers=off, lang=php}
~~~
// Find 50 most recent published posts
$posts = $entityManager->getRepository(Post::class)->findBy(
           ['status'=>Post::STATUS_PUBLISHED], 
           ['dateCreated'=>'DESC'], 50);
~~~

For your convenience, the `EntityRepository` class also provides magic methods allowing you to query entities by attribute name
with the `findByX` and `findOneByX` methods, as follows (just substitute the X placeholder with an attribute name):

{line-numbers=off, lang=php}
~~~
// Query a single post by ID attribute
$post = $entityManager->getRepository(Post::class)->findOneById(1);

// Query posts by status attribute
$posts = $entityManager->getRepository(Post::class)
        ->findByStatus(Post::STATUS_PUBLISHED);
~~~

And the most complex search method is the `createQueryBuilder()`. That method allows to create 
complex DQL queries. 

If standard find methods are not sufficient (or if you have complex search criterias and DQL queries),
you can create your own repository by extending the standard `EntityRepository` class
and encapsulate the search logic there. We will show how to do that later when implementing tag cloud feature
for our *Blog* sample.

## Adding Blog Home Page

To show how to use `EntityManager` class, we will create the main page for the *Blog* web application.
This page will display the list of posts sorted by date in descending order.

To do that, add the constructor method and `indexAction()` method to the 
`IndexController` controller class, as follows:

{line-numbers=on,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
namespace Application\Controller;

use Zend\Mvc\Controller\AbstractActionController;
use Zend\View\Model\ViewModel;
use Application\Entity\Post;

class IndexController extends AbstractActionController 
{
  /**
   * Entity manager.
   * @var Doctrine\ORM\EntityManager
   */
  private $entityManager;
  
  // Constructor method is used to inject dependencies to the controller.
  public function __construct($entityManager) 
  {
    $this->entityManager = $entityManager;
  }
  
  // This is the default "index" action of the controller. It displays the 
  // Posts page containing the recent blog posts.
  public function indexAction() 
  {
    // Get recent posts
    $posts = $this->entityManager->getRepository(Post::class)
                     ->findBy(['status'=>Post::STATUS_PUBLISHED], 
                              ['dateCreated'=>'DESC']);
        
    // Render the view template
    return new ViewModel([
      'posts' => $posts
    ]);
  }
}
~~~

In the code above, we first add the `__construct()` constructor method which is used to inject the Doctrine
entity manager into the controller (lines 16-19).

Inside of the `indexAction()` method, we get the repository of the `Post` entities with entity manager's `getRepository()` method (line 26).
With the `findBy()` method provided by repository, we select published posts sorted by date in
descending order. And, in line 31 we pass the selected posts to the view for rendering.

Next, create the factory for the `IndexController`. To do that, add the *IndexControllerFactory.php* file
inside of *Controller/Factory* directory under module's source directory. Put the following content to the
file:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
namespace Application\Controller\Factory;

use Interop\Container\ContainerInterface;
use Zend\ServiceManager\Factory\FactoryInterface;
use Application\Controller\IndexController;

/**
 * This is the factory for IndexController. Its purpose is to instantiate the
 * controller.
 */
class IndexControllerFactory implements FactoryInterface
{
    public function __invoke(ContainerInterface $container, 
                     $requestedName, array $options = null)
    {
        $entityManager = $container->get('doctrine.entitymanager.orm_default');
        
        // Instantiate the controller and inject dependencies
        return new IndexController($entityManager);
    }
}
~~~

In the code above, you can see how we instantiate the Doctrine entity manager and inject it into the controller.

Do not forget to register our controller's factory inside `module.config.php` file. To do that, add the following:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
//...
return [
    //...
    'controllers' => [
        //...
        'factories' => [
            Controller\IndexController::class => 
                            Controller\Factory\IndexControllerFactory::class,    
        ],
    ],
    //...
];
~~~

Next, modify the *index.phtml* view template file in *application/index* directory under module's
*view* directory and put the following content into it:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<h1>Posts</h1>

<?php foreach($posts as $post): ?>

<h3>
  <a href="#">
    <?= $this->escapeHtml($post->getTitle()); ?>
  </a>    
</h3>
        
<p>    
   <?= $this->escapeHtml($post->getContent()); ?>
</p>

<?php endforeach; ?>
~~~   

In the view template above, we go in turn through the posts we selected and render each one's
title and content. That simple!

Now, if you open the *Blog* web application in your browser, you should be able to see the 
following page containing the list of posts (look at figure 12.6 below).   
   
![Figure 12.6. List of posts](images/doctrine/blog_posts.png)   


## Adding New Post

In this section, we will create the *Add New Post* web page that will allow to add a new post to blog.
For this, we will need four things:

  * the `PostForm` form model will be used for entering and validation of post title, content, status and tags;
  * the `PostManager` service model will contain business logic for saving new post to database;
  * the `PostController` controller and its `PostController::addAction()` action method will be used for
    getting form data, and calling `PostManager` for saving the data to database.
  * and *add.phtml* view template will render the form.

### Adding PostForm

First, we add the `PostForm` form that will allow to enter data of a single post: 
its title, content, comma-separated list of tags associated with the post, and status (Published or 
Draft). To do that, create the *PostForm.php* file in *Form* directory under module's 
source directory. Put the following content into the file:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php

namespace Application\Form;

use Zend\Form\Form;
use Zend\InputFilter\InputFilter;
use Application\Entity\Post;

/**
 * This form is used to collect post data.
 */
class PostForm extends Form
{
    /**
     * Constructor.     
     */
    public function __construct()
    {
        // Define form name
        parent::__construct('post-form');
     
        // Set POST method for this form
        $this->setAttribute('method', 'post');
                
        $this->addElements();
        $this->addInputFilter();         
    }
    
    /**
     * This method adds elements to form (input fields and submit button).
     */
    protected function addElements() 
    {
                
        // Add "title" field
        $this->add([           
            'type'  => 'text',
            'name' => 'title',
            'attributes' => [
                'id' => 'title'
            ],
            'options' => [
                'label' => 'Title',
            ],
        ]);
        
        // Add "content" field
        $this->add([
            'type'  => 'textarea',
            'name' => 'content',
            'attributes' => [                
                'id' => 'content'
            ],
            'options' => [
                'label' => 'Content',
            ],
        ]);
        
        // Add "tags" field
        $this->add([
            'type'  => 'text',
            'name' => 'tags',
            'attributes' => [                
                'id' => 'tags'
            ],
            'options' => [
                'label' => 'Tags',
            ],
        ]);
        
        // Add "status" field
        $this->add([
            'type'  => 'select',
            'name' => 'status',
            'attributes' => [                
                'id' => 'status'
            ],
            'options' => [
                'label' => 'Status',
                'value_options' => [
                    Post::STATUS_PUBLISHED => 'Published',
                    Post::STATUS_DRAFT => 'Draft',
                ]
            ],
        ]);
        
        // Add the submit button
        $this->add([
            'type'  => 'submit',
            'name' => 'submit',
            'attributes' => [                
                'value' => 'Create',
                'id' => 'submitbutton',
            ],
        ]);
    }
    
    /**
     * This method creates input filter (used for form filtering/validation).
     */
    private function addInputFilter() 
    {
        
        $inputFilter = new InputFilter();        
        $this->setInputFilter($inputFilter);
        
        $inputFilter->add([
                'name'     => 'title',
                'required' => true,
                'filters'  => [
                    ['name' => 'StringTrim'],
                    ['name' => 'StripTags'],
                    ['name' => 'StripNewlines'],
                ],                
                'validators' => [
                    [
                        'name'    => 'StringLength',
                        'options' => [
                            'min' => 1,
                            'max' => 1024
                        ],
                    ],
                ],
            ]);
        
        $inputFilter->add([
                'name'     => 'content',
                'required' => true,
                'filters'  => [                    
                    ['name' => 'StripTags'],
                ],                
                'validators' => [
                    [
                        'name'    => 'StringLength',
                        'options' => [
                            'min' => 1,
                            'max' => 4096
                        ],
                    ],
                ],
            ]);   
        
        $inputFilter->add([
                'name'     => 'tags',
                'required' => true,
                'filters'  => [                    
                    ['name' => 'StringTrim'],
                    ['name' => 'StripTags'],
                    ['name' => 'StripNewlines'],
                ],                
                'validators' => [
                    [
                        'name'    => 'StringLength',
                        'options' => [
                            'min' => 1,
                            'max' => 1024
                        ],
                    ],
                ],
            ]);
    }
}
~~~

As you can see from the code above, the `PostForm` class defines a ZF3 form with title, content, 
tags, and status fields. It also has the *Submit* button.

I> Since we covered forms in details in previous chapters, here we do not explain the code 
I> presented above deeply.

### Adding PostManager Service

According to Domain Driven Design pattern, we put business logic into service models. In our *Blog*
sample, we will create and register the *PostManager* service. This service will have the `addNewPost()` 
public method that will contain business logic of adding `Post` entity to database and associating it with 
one or several `Tag` entities.

I> The `PostManager` service will contain business logic of the *Blog* sample. This business logic 
   includes, but not limited to, adding new post to the blog.

Create the *PostManager.php* file inside the *Service* directory under the module's
source directory. Put the following content into that file:

{line-numbers=on,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
namespace Application\Service;

use Application\Entity\Post;
use Application\Entity\Comment;
use Application\Entity\Tag;
use Zend\Filter\StaticFilter;

// The PostManager service is responsible for adding new posts.
class PostManager 
{
  /**
   * Doctrine entity manager.
   * @var Doctrine\ORM\EntityManager
   */
  private $entityManager;
  
  // Constructor is used to inject dependencies into the service.
  public function __construct($entityManager)
  {
    $this->entityManager = $entityManager;
  }
    
  // This method adds a new post.
  public function addNewPost($data) 
  {
    // Create new Post entity.
    $post = new Post();
    $post->setTitle($data['title']);
    $post->setContent($data['content']);
    $post->setStatus($data['status']);
    $currentDate = date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
    $post->setDateCreated($currentDate);        
        
    // Add the entity to entity manager.
    $this->entityManager->persist($post);
        
    // Add tags to post
    $this->addTagsToPost($data['tags'], $post);
        
    // Apply changes to database.
    $this->entityManager->flush();
  }
  
  // Adds/updates tags in the given post.
  private function addTagsToPost($tagsStr, $post) 
  {
    // Remove tag associations (if any)
    $tags = $post->getTags();
    foreach ($tags as $tag) {            
      $post->removeTagAssociation($tag);
    }
        
    // Add tags to post
    $tags = explode(',', $tagsStr);
    foreach ($tags as $tagName) {
            
      $tagName = StaticFilter::execute($tagName, 'StringTrim');
      if (empty($tagName)) {
        continue; 
      }
            
      $tag = $this->entityManager->getRepository(Tag::class)
                 ->findOneByName($tagName);
      if ($tag == null)
        $tag = new Tag();
      $tag->setName($tagName);
      $tag->addPost($post);
            
      $this->entityManager->persist($tag);
            
      $post->addTag($tag);
    }
  }    
}
~~~

In lines 25-43, we have the `addNewPost()` public method which takes the `$data` variable as argument (this variable
should contain the data entered by the website user into the form). We create a new instance of `Post` entity (line 28) and fill its
properties with user-provided data. We use the `EntityManager`'s `persist()` method (line 36) to add the newly
created entity to entity manager. The `addTagsToPost()` private method is called (line 39) to assign
the post with one or several tags. And the `flush()` method is used for applying changes to database
in a single transaction (line 42).

The `addTagsToPost()` private method contains logic for removing old associations between the post and
tags (lines 49-52), then parsing comma-separated list of tags (line 55), and assigning new tags to the 
post (lines 56-73).

Next, add a factory for the `PostManager` service. To do that, add the *PostManagerFactory.php* file under
the *Service/Factory* directory under the module's source directory. Put the following content into that file:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
namespace Application\Service\Factory;

use Interop\Container\ContainerInterface;
use Zend\ServiceManager\Factory\FactoryInterface;
use Application\Service\PostManager;

/**
 * This is the factory for PostManager. Its purpose is to instantiate the
 * service.
 */
class PostManagerFactory implements FactoryInterface
{
    public function __invoke(ContainerInterface $container, 
                    $requestedName, array $options = null)
    {
        $entityManager = $container->get('doctrine.entitymanager.orm_default');
        
        // Instantiate the service and inject dependencies
        return new PostManager($entityManager);
    }
}
~~~

Finally, we register `PostManager` service by modifying *module.config.php* configuration file as follows:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
//...
return [
    //...
    'service_manager' => [
        //...
        'factories' => [
            Service\PostManager::class => Service\Factory\PostManagerFactory::class,
        ],
    ],
    //...
];
~~~  
  
### Creating Controller Action and View Template  

For post management (e.g. adding, editing, viewing and removing posts), we will create the 
`PostController` controller class. We create the `addAction()` action method inside the 
`PostController` controller class that will allow to add a new post to blog (see code below):

{line-numbers=on,lang=php}
~~~
class PostController extends AbstractActionController 
{
    /**
     * Entity manager.
     * @var Doctrine\ORM\EntityManager 
     */
    private $entityManager;
    
    /**
     * Post manager.
     * @var Application\Service\PostManager 
     */
    private $postManager;
    
    /**
     * Constructor is used for injecting dependencies into the controller.
     */
    public function __construct($entityManager, $postManager) 
    {
        $this->entityManager = $entityManager;
        $this->postManager = $postManager;
    }

    /**
     * This action displays the "New Post" page. The page contains 
     * a form allowing to enter post title, content and tags. When 
     * the user clicks the Submit button, a new Post entity will 
     * be created.
     */
    public function addAction() 
    {     
        // Create the form.
        $form = new PostForm();
        
        // Check whether this post is a POST request.
        if ($this->getRequest()->isPost()) {
            
            // Get POST data.
            $data = $this->params()->fromPost();
            
            // Fill form with data.
            $form->setData($data);
            if ($form->isValid()) {
                                
                // Get validated form data.
                $data = $form->getData();
                
                // Use post manager service to add new post to database.                
                $this->postManager->addNewPost($data);
                
                // Redirect the user to "index" page.
                return $this->redirect()->toRoute('application');
            }
        }
        
        // Render the view template.
        return new ViewModel([
            'form' => $form
        ]);
    }   
}
~~~

Above, in line 33, we create an instance of `PostForm` form. 
In line 36, we check whether this is a POST request. If the request is a POST request, we fill the
form with input data and validate the data. In case of valid data, we call the `addNewPost()` method
on the `PostManager` service (line 49), and redirect the user to the list of posts.

To instantiate the `PostController`, we will need a factory. Create the controller factory by adding the 
*PostControllerFactory.php* file to the *Controller/Factory* directory under the module's source directory:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
namespace Application\Controller\Factory;

use Interop\Container\ContainerInterface;
use Zend\ServiceManager\Factory\FactoryInterface;
use Application\Service\PostManager;
use Application\Controller\PostController;

/**
 * This is the factory for PostController. Its purpose is to instantiate the
 * controller.
 */
class PostControllerFactory implements FactoryInterface
{
    public function __invoke(ContainerInterface $container, 
                           $requestedName, array $options = null)
    {
        $entityManager = $container->get('doctrine.entitymanager.orm_default');
        $postManager = $container->get(PostManager::class);
        
        // Instantiate the controller and inject dependencies
        return new PostController($entityManager, $postManager);
    }
}
~~~

Next, register the `PostController` controller inside the *module.config.php* file:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
//...
return [
    //...
    'controllers' => [
        //...
        'factories' => [
            Controller\PostController::class => 
                           Controller\Factory\PostControllerFactory::class,
        ],
    ],
    //...
];
~~~ 

Then, add the *posts* route for the new controller (modify the *module.config.php* as follows):

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
//...
return [
    //...
    'router' => [
        'routes' => [
            //...
            'posts' => [
                'type'    => Segment::class,
                'options' => [
                    'route'    => '/posts[/:action[/:id]]',
                    'constraints' => [
                        'action' => '[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*',
                        'id' => '[0-9]*'
                    ],
                    'defaults' => [
                        'controller'    => Controller\PostController::class,
                        'action'        => 'index',
                    ],
                ],
            ],
        ],
    ],
    //...
];
~~~

Finally, we add the view template. Create the *add.phtml* file in *application/post* directory under
module's *view* directory and put the following content into it:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
$form = $this->form;
$form->get('title')->setAttributes([
    'class'=>'form-control', 
    'placeholder'=>'Enter post title here'
    ]);
$form->get('content')->setAttributes([
    'class'=>'form-control', 
    'placeholder'=>'Type content here',
    'rows'=>6
    ]);
$form->get('tags')->setAttributes([
    'class'=>'form-control', 
    'placeholder'=>'comma, separated, list, of, tags'
    ]);
$form->get('status')->setAttributes([
    'class'=>'form-control'   
    ]);
$form->get('submit')->setAttributes(['class'=>'btn btn-primary']);
$form->prepare();

?>

<h1>Add New Post</h1>

<p>
    Please fill out the following form and click the <i>Create</i> button.
</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <?= $this->form()->openTag($form); ?>
        
        <div class="form-group">
            <?= $this->formLabel($form->get('title')); ?>
            <?= $this->formElement($form->get('title')); ?>
            <?= $this->formElementErrors($form->get('title')); ?>                  
        </div>
        
        <div class="form-group">
            <?= $this->formLabel($form->get('content')); ?>
            <?= $this->formElement($form->get('content')); ?>
            <?= $this->formElementErrors($form->get('content')); ?>                  
        </div>
        
        <div class="form-group">
            <?= $this->formLabel($form->get('tags')); ?>
            <?= $this->formElement($form->get('tags')); ?>
            <?= $this->formElementErrors($form->get('tags')); ?>                  
            <p class="help-block">Separate tags with comma.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="form-group">
            <?= $this->formLabel($form->get('status')); ?>
            <?= $this->formElement($form->get('status')); ?>
            <?= $this->formElementErrors($form->get('status')); ?>                  
        </div>
        
        <?= $this->formElement($form->get('submit')); ?>
        
        <?= $this->form()->closeTag(); ?>
    </div>    
</div>   
~~~

Now, if you open the URL *http://localhost/posts/add* in your web browser, you should see 
the *Add New Post* page like shown in figure 12.7 below:

![Figure 12.7. Add New Post page](images/doctrine/add_new_post.png) 

Filling the form and clicking the *Create* button results in saving the new post to database. Then you
are able to see the newly created post in the list of posts at the *Home* page.

## Editing Existing Post

In this section, we will implement the *Edit Post* page which contains the form allowing to edit 
the data of existing post, send new data to server and apply changes to database. Site visitor will
be able to see the page by entering the following URL in browser's navigation
bar: *http://localhost/posts/edit/&lt;id&gt;*, where *&lt;id&gt;* is the unique 
identifier of the post.

To implement this page we need the following things:

  * create a form that would allow to enter post title, content, etc. For this page, we can 
    successfully reuse the `PostForm` form we created earlier (we just rename the *Create* button
    caption into *Save*).
  * add `updatePost()` method to the `PostManager` service. The method would find the post by 
    ID in database and update its data;
  * add `convertTagsToString()` method to the `PostManager` service. This method would take the
    post entity, and on output produce string containing comma-separated list of tags;
  * add the `PostController::editAction()` action method that would take user input, pass it 
    to models and return data for rendering;
  * and add the *edit.phtml* view template file that would render the form.

### Modifying PostManager  
  
First, we add the `updatePost()` and `convertTagsToString()` methods to the `PostManager` service 
model as follows:

{line-numbers=on,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
//...
class PostManager
{
    //...
	
    // This method allows to update data of a single post.
    public function updatePost($post, $data) 
    {
        $post->setTitle($data['title']);
        $post->setContent($data['content']);
        $post->setStatus($data['status']);
        
        // Add tags to post
        $this->addTagsToPost($data['tags'], $post);
        
        // Apply changes to database.
        $this->entityManager->flush();
    }
        
    // Converts tags of the given post to comma separated list (string).
    public function convertTagsToString($post) 
    {
        $tags = $post->getTags();
        $tagCount = count($tags);
        $tagsStr = '';
        $i = 0;
        foreach ($tags as $tag) {
            $i ++;
            $tagsStr .= $tag->getName();
            if ($i < $tagCount) 
                $tagsStr .= ', ';
        }
        
        return $tagsStr;
    }    
}
~~~
  
Above, we have the `updatePost()` method (lines 8-19) that takes an existing `Post` entity, 
the new title, content, status and the list of tags. It then updates entity's properties and 
saves changes to database using `flush()` method.

I> Note that the `updatePost()` method doesn't use the `persist()` method of entity manager, because
   here we have existing post, not a new one.
  
Then, we have the `convertTagsToString()` method (lines 22-36) which takes the post, goes through 
`Tag` entities associated with the post and formats and returns the comma-separated list of tags.  

### Adding Controller Action and View Template
  
Next, add the `editAction` to `PostController` controller class as follows:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
namespace Application\Controller;
//...
use Application\Form\PostForm;
use Application\Entity\Post;

class PostController extends AbstractActionController 
{
  // This action displays the page allowing to edit a post.
  public function editAction() 
  {
    // Create the form.
    $form = new PostForm();
    
    // Get post ID.    
    $postId = $this->params()->fromRoute('id', -1);
    
    // Find existing post in the database.    
    $post = $this->entityManager->getRepository(Post::class)
                ->findOneById($postId);        
    if ($post == null) {
      $this->getResponse()->setStatusCode(404);
      return;                        
    } 
        
    // Check whether this post is a POST request.
    if ($this->getRequest()->isPost()) {
            
      // Get POST data.
      $data = $this->params()->fromPost();
            
      // Fill form with data.
      $form->setData($data);
      if ($form->isValid()) {
                                
        // Get validated form data.
        $data = $form->getData();
                
        // Use post manager service to add new post to database.                
        $this->postManager->updatePost($post, $data);
                
        // Redirect the user to "admin" page.
        return $this->redirect()->toRoute('posts', ['action'=>'admin']);
      }
    } else {
      $data = [
               'title' => $post->getTitle(),
               'content' => $post->getContent(),
               'tags' => $this->postManager->convertTagsToString($post),
               'status' => $post->getStatus()
            ];
            
      $form->setData($data);
    }
        
    // Render the view template.
    return new ViewModel([
            'form' => $form,
            'post' => $post
        ]);  
  }
}
~~~

In the code above, we extract the post ID using the `fromRoute()` method of the `params()` controller
plugin. Then we search for post having such ID using the `findOneBy()` method provided by the
entity repository. 

Then we check if this is a POST request. If this is the POST request, we fill in and validate the form
with POST data. Then we use the `updatePost()` method of the `PostManager` service.

Finally, create the *application/post/edit.phtml* file under the module's *view* directory. Place the
following content there:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
$form = $this->form;
$form->get('title')->setAttributes([
    'class'=>'form-control', 
    'placeholder'=>'Enter post title here'
    ]);
$form->get('content')->setAttributes([
    'class'=>'form-control', 
    'placeholder'=>'Type content here',
    'rows'=>6
    ]);
$form->get('tags')->setAttributes([
    'class'=>'form-control', 
    'placeholder'=>'comma, separated, list, of, tags'
    ]);
$form->get('status')->setAttributes([
    'class'=>'form-control'   
    ]);
$form->get('submit')->setAttributes(['class'=>'btn btn-primary']);
$form->get('submit')->setValue('Save');
$form->prepare();

?>

<h1>Edit Post</h1>

<p>
    Please fill out the following form and click the *Save* button.
</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <?= $this->form()->openTag($form); ?>
        
        <div class="form-group">
            <?= $this->formLabel($form->get('title')); ?>
            <?= $this->formElement($form->get('title')); ?>
            <?= $this->formElementErrors($form->get('title')); ?>                  
        </div>
        
        <div class="form-group">
            <?= $this->formLabel($form->get('content')); ?>
            <?= $this->formElement($form->get('content')); ?>
            <?= $this->formElementErrors($form->get('content')); ?>                  
        </div>
        
        <div class="form-group">
            <?= $this->formLabel($form->get('tags')); ?>
            <?= $this->formElement($form->get('tags')); ?>
            <?= $this->formElementErrors($form->get('tags')); ?>                  
            <p class="help-block">Separate tags with comma.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="form-group">
            <?= $this->formLabel($form->get('status')); ?>
            <?= $this->formElement($form->get('status')); ?>
            <?= $this->formElementErrors($form->get('status')); ?>                  
        </div>
        
        <?= $this->formElement($form->get('submit')); ?>
        
        <?= $this->form()->closeTag(); ?>
    </div>    
</div>   
~~~

Now, if you open the URL *http://localhost/posts/edit/&lt;id&gt;* in your web browser, 
you should be able to see the *Edit Post* page that allows to edit an existing post (see the figure 12.8 below):

![Figure 12.8. Edit Post page](images/doctrine/edit_post.png) 

Clicking the *Save* button results in saving the changes to database. 

## Deleting a Post

In this section, we will implement the `deleteAction()` action of the `PostController`. This action 
will allow to delete certain post given its ID. The action will take ID as a GET variable, look if 
a post with such ID exists, and if exists, deletes the post, its related comments and tag associations. 
Site visitor will be able to trigger the action by entering the following URL in browser's navigation
bar: *http://localhost/posts/delete/&lt;id&gt;*, where *&lt;id&gt;* is the unique 
identifier of the post. Finally, the action redirects the site visitor to the *Admin* page.

### Modifying PostManager

First, we'll add the `removePost()` method to the `PostManager` service. This method will remove the
post and its associated comments. It will also remove associations between post and tags.

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
//...
class PostManager
{
  //...
    
  // Removes post and all associated comments.
  public function removePost($post) 
  {
    // Remove associated comments
    $comments = $post->getComments();
    foreach ($comments as $comment) {
      $this->entityManager->remove($comment);
    }
        
    // Remove tag associations (if any)
    $tags = $post->getTags();
    foreach ($tags as $tag) {
      $post->removeTagAssociation($tag);
    }
        
    $this->entityManager->remove($post);
        
    $this->entityManager->flush();
  }
}
~~~

In the code above, we first retrieve all comments associated with the post using the `getComments()`
method of the `Post` entity. Then we call `EntityManager`'s `remove()` method and pass it each comment
that we want to remove.

Next, we get all tags associated with the post by calling `Post`'s `getTags()` method. We remove
association between the post and tag (but not tag itself!) with the help of the `Post`'s `removeTagAssociation()`
method (see below for the code of the method).

Finally, we remove the post itself by calling the `EntityManager`'s `remove()` method. We apply changes
to database with the `flush()` method.

And here is the code of the `Post::removeTagAssociation()` method:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
// Removes association between this post and the given tag.
public function removeTagAssociation($tag) 
{
  $this->tags->removeElement($tag);
}
~~~

### Adding Controller Action

The `PostController::deleteAction()` method retrieves the ID of the post to be removed, checks
whether this is a valid post ID. If so, it calls the `PostManager::removePost()` method to
remove the post and apply changes to database. Finally, it redirects the site visitor to the *Admin* page.

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php

//..
class PostController extends AbstractActionController 
{
  // This "delete" action displays the Delete Post page.
  public function deleteAction()
  {
    $postId = $this->params()->fromRoute('id', -1);
        
    $post = $this->entityManager->getRepository(Post::class)
                ->findOneById($postId);        
    if ($post == null) {
      $this->getResponse()->setStatusCode(404);
      return;                        
    }        
        
    $this->postManager->removePost($post);
        
    // Redirect the user to "index" page.
    return $this->redirect()->toRoute('posts', ['action'=>'admin']);
  }
}
~~~

## Implementing Post Preview

In this section, we will create controller's action and its corresponding view template that would
allow site visitors to preview certain post by entering the following URL in browser's navigation
bar: *http://localhost/posts/view/&lt;id&gt;*, where *&lt;id&gt;* is the unique identifier 
of the post.

The page will also allow to add comments to the post using the form located at the bottom of the page.
For example of what we are trying to achive, please look at the figure 12.9 below:

![Figure 12.9. View Post page](images/doctrine/view_post.png) 

So, for this we need four things:

  * to create the form that would allow to enter the comment and its author's name;
  * to modify the `PostManager` and add all necessary business logic;
  * to create `PostController::viewAction()` controller's action;
  * and to create the *view.phtml* view template.

### Adding CommentForm

First, we implement the `CommentForm` form that will allow to add a comment to a post. 
Create the *CommentForm.php* file in *Form* directory under module's source directory. 
Put the following content into the file:

{line-numbers=on,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
namespace Application\Form;

use Zend\Form\Form;
use Zend\InputFilter\InputFilter;

/**
 * This form is used to collect comment data.
 */
class CommentForm extends Form
{
  // Constructor.     
  public function __construct()
  {
    // Define form name
    parent::__construct('comment-form');
     
    // Set POST method for this form
    $this->setAttribute('method', 'post');
                
    $this->addElements();
    $this->addInputFilter();         
  }
    
  // This method adds elements to form (input fields and submit button).
  protected function addElements() 
  {
    // Add "author" field
    $this->add([     
            'type'  => 'text',
            'name' => 'author',
            'attributes' => [
                'id' => 'author'
            ],
            'options' => [
                'label' => 'Author',
            ],
        ]);
        
    // Add "comment" field
    $this->add([            
           'type'  => 'textarea',
            'name' => 'comment',
            'attributes' => [
                'id' => 'comment'
            ],
            'options' => [
                'label' => 'Comment',
            ],
        ]);
                
    // Add the submit button
    $this->add([
            'type'  => 'submit',
            'name' => 'submit',
            'attributes' => [                
                'value' => 'Save',
                'id' => 'submitbutton',
            ],
        ]);
  }
    
  // This method creates input filter (used for form filtering/validation).
  private function addInputFilter() 
  {
    $inputFilter = new InputFilter();        
    $this->setInputFilter($inputFilter);
        
    $inputFilter->add([
                'name'     => 'author',
                'required' => true,
                'filters'  => [                    
                    ['name' => 'StringTrim'],
                ],                
                'validators' => [
                    [
                        'name'    => 'StringLength',
                        'options' => [
                            'min' => 1,
                            'max' => 128
                        ],
                    ],
                ],
            ]);
        
    $inputFilter->add([
                'name'     => 'comment',
                'required' => true,
                'filters'  => [                    
                    ['name' => 'StripTags'],
                ],                
                'validators' => [
                    [
                        'name'    => 'StringLength',
                        'options' => [
                            'min' => 1,
                            'max' => 4096
                        ],
                    ],
                ],
            ]);   
  }
}
~~~

As you see from the code above, the `CommentForm` form contains the author, comment fields, and the Submit button.

I> Since we covered forms in details in previous chapters, here we do not explain the code 
I> presented above deeply.

### Modifying PostManager

Here, we add two methods:

  * the `getCommentCountStr()` method will format the comment count string for the given post 
    (e.g., "No comments", "1 comment", "2 comments", etc.)
  * and the `addCommentToPost()` method will be used for adding a new comment to post.
	
{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
//...

/**
 * The PostManager service is responsible for adding new posts.
 */
class PostManager
{
    //...    

    // Returns count of comments for given post as properly formatted string.
    public function getCommentCountStr($post)
    {
        $commentCount = count($post->getComments());
        if ($commentCount == 0)
            return 'No comments';
        else if ($commentCount == 1) 
            return '1 comment';
        else
            return $commentCount . ' comments';
    }


    // This method adds a new comment to post.
    public function addCommentToPost($post, $data) 
    {
        // Create new Comment entity.
        $comment = new Comment();
        $comment->setPost($post);
        $comment->setAuthor($data['author']);
        $comment->setContent($data['comment']);        
        $currentDate = date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
        $comment->setDateCreated($currentDate);

        // Add the entity to entity manager.
        $this->entityManager->persist($comment);

        // Apply changes.
        $this->entityManager->flush();
    }
}
~~~

### Adding Controller Action and View Template

Now, add the `PostController::viewAction()` method and put the following code there:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
//...
use Application\Form\CommentForm;
use Application\Entity\Comment;

class PostController extends AbstractActionController 
{
  /**
   * This action displays the "View Post" page allowing to see the post title
   * and content. The page also contains a form allowing
   * to add a comment to post. 
   */
  public function viewAction() 
  {       
    $postId = $this->params()->fromRoute('id', -1);
        
    $post = $this->entityManager->getRepository(Post::class)
              ->findOneById($postId);
        
    if ($post == null) {
      $this->getResponse()->setStatusCode(404);
      return;                        
    }        
        
    $commentCount = $this->postManager->getCommentCountStr($post);
        
    // Create the form.
    $form = new CommentForm();
        
    // Check whether this post is a POST request.
    if($this->getRequest()->isPost()) {
            
      // Get POST data.
      $data = $this->params()->fromPost();
            
      // Fill form with data.
      $form->setData($data);
      if($form->isValid()) {
                                
        // Get validated form data.
        $data = $form->getData();
              
        // Use post manager service to add new comment to post.
        $this->postManager->addCommentToPost($post, $data);
                
        // Redirect the user again to "view" page.
        return $this->redirect()->toRoute('posts', ['action'=>'view', 'id'=>$postId]);
      }
    }
        
    // Render the view template.
    return new ViewModel([
      'post' => $post,
      'commentCount' => $commentCount,
      'form' => $form,
      'postManager' => $this->postManager
    ]);
  }      
}
~~~ 

Finally, add the *view.phtml* view template file and put the following content there:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
$form = $this->form;
$form->get('author')->setAttributes([
    'class'=>'form-control', 
    'placeholder'=>'Author\'s name'
    ]);
$form->get('comment')->setAttributes([
    'class'=>'form-control',
    'rows'=>6, 
    'placeholder'=>'Text'
    ]);
$form->get('submit')->setAttributes(['class'=>'btn btn-primary']);
$form->prepare();        
?>

<a href="
    <?= $this->url('application', ['action'=>'index']); ?>">
    &lt;&lt; Back to list of posts
</a>

<h1>
    <?= $this->escapeHtml($post->getTitle()); ?>    
</h1>

<p class="comments-header">
    <?= $this->escapeHtml($postManager->getCommentCountStr($post)); ?> | 
    <a href="#comment">
        Add new comment
    </a>
</p>

<p>
    Published: <?= $this->escapeHtml(date('jS \of F Y', strtotime($post->getDateCreated()))); ?> 
    | Tags: <?= $this->escapeHtml($postManager->convertTagsToString($post)); ?>   
</p>

<p>    
    <?= $this->escapeHtml($post->getContent()); ?>
</p>

<h3><?= $this->escapeHtml($postManager->getCommentCountStr($post)); ?></h3>

<?php foreach ($post->getComments() as $comment): ?>

<hr>

<p>
    <?= $this->escapeHtml($comment->getAuthor()) ?> on 
    <?= $this->escapeHtml($comment->getDateCreated()); ?>
</p>

<p>
    <?= $this->escapeHtml($comment->getContent()); ?>    
</p>

<?php endforeach; ?>

<hr>

<a name="comment"></a>
<h3>Leave Reply</h3>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">
        <?= $this->form()->openTag($form); ?>
        
        <div class="form-group">
            <?= $this->formLabel($form->get('author')); ?>
            <?= $this->formElement($form->get('author')); ?>
            <?= $this->formElementErrors($form->get('author')); ?>                  
        </div>
        
        <div class="form-group">
            <?= $this->formLabel($form->get('comment')); ?>
            <?= $this->formElement($form->get('comment')); ?>
            <?= $this->formElementErrors($form->get('comment')); ?>                  
        </div>
        
        <?= $this->formElement($form->get('submit')); ?>
        
        <?= $this->form()->closeTag(); ?>
    </div>    
</div>   
~~~

## Implementing Admin Page

Admin page of the *Blog* sample web application contains the list of all blog posts (either 
published or drafts), and allows to view, edit and delete posts.

To implement this page, add the `adminAction()` action method to the `PostController` 
class, as follows:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php

//..
class PostController extends AbstractActionController 
{
  /**
   * This "admin" action displays the Manage Posts page. This page contains
   * the list of posts with an ability to edit/delete any post.
  */
  public function adminAction()
  {
    // Get posts
    $posts = $this->entityManager->getRepository(Post::class)
               ->findBy([], ['dateCreated'=>'DESC']);
        
    // Render the view template
    return new ViewModel([
            'posts' => $posts,
            'postManager' => $this->postManager
        ]);        
  }
}
~~~

We will also need to show a post status in text form ('Draft' or 'Published'). 
Conversion of integer post status to string can be implemented in the `getPostStatusAsString()` method
of `PostManager` service. Add the `getPostStatusAsString()` method to `PostManager` class 
as follows:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
/**
 * Returns status as a string.
 */
public function getPostStatusAsString($post) 
{
    switch ($post->getStatus()) {
        case Post::STATUS_DRAFT: return 'Draft';
        case Post::STATUS_PUBLISHED: return 'Published';
    }
    
    return 'Unknown';
}
~~~
    
Finally, add the corresponding view template file *admin.phtml* to the *application/post* directory
under module's *view* directory:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<h1>Manage Posts</h1>

<p>
<a class="btn btn-default" href="
    <?= $this->url('posts', ['action'=>'add']); ?>">
    New Post
</a>
</p>

<table class="table table-striped">

   <tr>
        <th>ID</th>
        <th>Post Title</th>
        <th>Date Created</th>
        <th>Status</th>        
        <th>Actions</th>        
    </tr>
    
    <?php foreach ($posts as $post): ?>
    
    <tr>
        <td><?= $this->escapeHtml($post->getId()); ?></td>
        <td>
            <a href="<?= $this->url('posts', ['action'=>'view', 'id'=>$post->getId()]); ?>">
                <?= $this->escapeHtml($post->getTitle()); ?>
            </a> 
        </td>
        <td><?= $this->escapeHtml($post->getDateCreated()); ?></td>        
        <td><?= $this->escapeHtml($postManager->getPostStatusAsString($post)); ?></td>
        <td>
            <a class="btn btn-info" href="<?= $this->url('posts', 
                    ['action'=>'edit', 'id'=>$post->getId()]); ?>">
                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil" ></span> Edit
            </a>
            <a class="btn btn-danger" href="<?= $this->url('posts',
                    ['action'=>'delete', 'id'=>$post->getId()]); ?>">
                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove"></span> Delete
            </a>
        </td>    
    </tr>
        
    <?php endforeach; ?>   
    
</table>
~~~

Now, if you open the URL *http://localhost/posts/admin* in web browser's navigation bar,
you should be able to see the page like in figure 12.10 below:

![Figure 12.10. Blog Admin page](images/doctrine/blog_admin_page.png)  

## Implementing Tag Cloud

Another major feature we implement in the *Blog* sample will be the tag cloud. The tag cloud appears on 
the *Home* page. The tag cloud contains most popular tags, and tag's font size varies depending on 
popularity of the tag: most popular tags appear larger than less popular ones. Clicking the tag in 
the tag cloud results in filtering posts by this tag.

For example of what we are trying to achieve, please look at the right side of the figure 12.11 below:

![Figure 12.11. Tag cloud](images/doctrine/tag_cloud.png)  

For this feature, we need the following things:

  * to create the `PostRepository` custom entity repository class that would encapsulate the complex logic 
    of filtering posts by tag;
  * to modify the `PostManager` and add functionality for calculating font sizes for the tag cloud;
  * to add controller's action and corresponding view template.

### Adding Custom Post Repository

Earlier we mentioned that by default Doctrine uses the `Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository` as the 
default repository class. Custom repository is a class extended from `EntityRepository` class. 
It is typically used when you need to encapsulate complex DQL queries and search logic in a single place in your code. 

I> It is also possible to put the DQL queries to controller class, but that would make controllers "fat".
   Since we use MVC pattern, we strive to avoid that.

I> DQL is similar to SQL in sense that it allows to write and execute queries to database, but the result 
   of a query is an array of objects rather than an array of table rows. For more information on DQL
   and its usage examples, please refer to this [page](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/en/latest/reference/dql-doctrine-query-language.html).

For our *Blog* sample web application, we need a custom repository which allows to find published
posts having at least one tag (to calculate total count of tagged posts), and, to find published 
posts filtered by particular tag. We plan to encapsulate this search logic into the custom `PostRepository` repository. 

I> Doctrine works with custom repositories transparently. This means, that you retrieve the repository
   from `EntityManager` as usual and still can use its `findBy()`, `findOneBy()` and other methods.

Create the *PostRepository.php* file inside the *Repository* directory under the module's source directory.
Below, you can find the code of `PostRepository` class that has two public methods:

  * the `findPostsHavingAnyTag()` method is designed to select all posts that have status *Published* 
    and have one or more tags assigned;
  * and the `findPostsByTag()` method is designed to return all published posts that have the particular tag
    assigned (to filter posts by the given tag).

{line-numbers=on,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
namespace Application\Repository;

use Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository;
use Application\Entity\Post;

// This is the custom repository class for Post entity.
class PostRepository extends EntityRepository
{
  // Finds all published posts having any tag.
  public function findPostsHavingAnyTag()
  {
    $entityManager = $this->getEntityManager();
        
    $queryBuilder = $entityManager->createQueryBuilder();
    
    $queryBuilder->select('p')
        ->from(Post::class, 'p')
        ->join('p.tags', 't')
        ->where('p.status = ?1')
        ->orderBy('p.dateCreated', 'DESC')
        ->setParameter('1', Post::STATUS_PUBLISHED);
    
    $posts = $queryBuilder->getQuery()->getResult();
    
    return $posts;
  }
    
  // Finds all published posts having the given tag.
  public function findPostsByTag($tagName)
  {
    $entityManager = $this->getEntityManager();
        
    $queryBuilder = $entityManager->createQueryBuilder();
    
    $queryBuilder->select('p')
        ->from(Post::class, 'p')
        ->join('p.tags', 't')
        ->where('p.status = ?1')
        ->andWhere('t.name = ?2')
        ->orderBy('p.dateCreated', 'DESC')
        ->setParameter('1', Post::STATUS_PUBLISHED)
        ->setParameter('2', $tagName);
    
    $posts = $queryBuilder->getQuery()->getResult();
            
    return $posts;
  }        
}
~~~

In the code above, we use the *query builder* to conveniently create complex DQL queries.

In lines 17-22, we create a query which selects all published posts ordering them by date created in descending
order. Because we join posts with tags, here we only select posts which have at least one tag. In line 24, we
execute the query. If you are curious what DQL the query builder creates, here it is: 

~~~
SELECT p FROM \Application\Entity\Post p JOIN p.tags t 
WHERE p.status=?1 ORDER BY p.dateCreated DESC
~~~

In lines 36-43, we create a query that filters posts by tag name. An analogous DQL is presented below:

~~~
SELECT p FROM \Application\Entity\Post p JOIN p.tags t 
WHERE p.status=?1 AND t.name=?2 ORDER BY p.dateCreated DESC
~~~

T> To learn more about Doctrine query builder, please refer to 
T> [this page](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/query-builder.html).

To let Doctrine know that it should use the custom repository for `Post` entity, 
modify the `Post` entity's annotation as follows:

{line-numbers=on,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
//...

/**
 * This class represents a single post in a blog.
 * @ORM\Entity(repositoryClass="\Application\Repository\PostRepository")
 * @ORM\Table(name="post")
 */
class Post 
{
  //...
}
~~~

Above, in line 6, we use the `repositoryClass` parameter of the `@ORM\Entity` tag to tell Doctrine
that it should use `PostRepository` repository.

### Calculating Tag Cloud

Business logic for the tag cloud feature will be stored inside of the `PostManager::getTagCloud()` method,
as follows:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
//...
class PostManager 
{
  //...
	
  // Calculates frequencies of tag usage.
  public function getTagCloud()
  {
    $tagCloud = [];
               
    $posts = $this->entityManager->getRepository(Post::class)
                    ->findPostsHavingAnyTag();
    $totalPostCount = count($posts);
        
    $tags = $this->entityManager->getRepository(Tag::class)
                ->findAll();
    foreach ($tags as $tag) {
            
      $postsByTag = $this->entityManager->getRepository(Post::class)
                    ->findPostsByTag($tag->getName());
            
      $postCount = count($postsByTag);
      if ($postCount > 0) {
        $tagCloud[$tag->getName()] = $postCount;
      }
    }
        
    $normalizedTagCloud = [];
        
    // Normalize
    foreach ($tagCloud as $name=>$postCount) {
      $normalizedTagCloud[$name] =  $postCount/$totalPostCount;
    }
        
    return $normalizedTagCloud;
  }
}
~~~

In the code above, we have the `getTagCloud()` method that selects all post having at least
one tag attached and calculates the "frequency" of each available tag (how often the tag appears).
Then it normalizes the frequency valies (makes them to be between 0 and 1.0).

### Modifying Controller Action

Here we will modify the `IndexController` to implement tag filter.

{line-numbers=on,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
//...
class IndexController extends AbstractActionController 
{
    /**
     * Post manager.
     * @var Application\Service\PostManager 
     */
    private $postManager;
    
    // Constructor is used for injecting dependencies into the controller.
    public function __construct($entityManager, $postManager) 
    {
        $this->entityManager = $entityManager;
        $this->postManager = $postManager;
    }
    
    public function indexAction() 
    {
        $tagFilter = $this->params()->fromQuery('tag', null);
        
        if ($tagFilter) {
         
            // Filter posts by tag
            $posts = $this->entityManager->getRepository(Post::class)
                    ->findPostsByTag($tagFilter);
            
        } else {
            // Get recent posts
            $posts = $this->entityManager->getRepository(Post::class)
                    ->findBy(['status'=>Post::STATUS_PUBLISHED], 
                             ['dateCreated'=>'DESC']);
        }
        
        // Get popular tags.
        $tagCloud = $this->postManager->getTagCloud();
        
        // Render the view template.
        return new ViewModel([
            'posts' => $posts,
            'postManager' => $this->postManager,
            'tagCloud' => $tagCloud
        ]);
    }
}
~~~

The action method will retrieve the tag from the GET variable `tag` if the variable doesn't
present in HTTP request, all posts are retrieved as usual. If the variable present, we use our
custom repository's `findPostsByTag()` method to filter posts.

In line 36, we call the `PostManager::getTagCloud()` that returns array of tags and their frequencies.
We use this information for rendering the cloud.

I> Please note that we are now using the `PostManager` service in our controller and have to inject it into
I> the constructor. Do not forget to modify the controller factory to do that.

### Rendering Tag Cloud

Finally, modify the *index.phtml* file to make it look like follows:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<h1>Posts</h1>

<div class="row">
    
    <div class="col-md-8">

    <?php foreach($posts as $post): ?>

    <h3>
        <a href="<?= $this->url('posts', ['action'=>'view', 'id'=>$post->getId()]); ?>">
            <?= $this->escapeHtml($post->getTitle()); ?>
        </a>    
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        Published: <?= $this->escapeHtml(date('jS \of F Y', strtotime($post->getDateCreated()))); ?> 
        | Tags: <?= $this->escapeHtml($postManager->convertTagsToString($post)); ?>   
    </p>    
        
    <p class="comments-header">
        <?= $this->escapeHtml($postManager->getCommentCountStr($post)); ?> | 
        <a href="<?= $this->url('posts', ['action'=>'view', 'id'=>$post->getId()],
                ['fragment'=>'comment']); ?>">
            Add new comment
        </a>
    </p>

    <p>    
        <?= $this->escapeHtml($post->getContent()); ?>
    </p>

## Implementing Pagination

For now we have only several posts on our *Posts* page. But assume there are many (hundreds of) posts. The page will
be loading very slowly. Also, it would be 
very inconvenient to scroll the page to read all posts. In this situation, *pagination* would help. 

I> *Pagination* is when you divide your results into pages and navigate through pages by clicking page
I> number links on pagination widget.

An example of pagination widget styled with Twitter Bootstrap is presented below:

![Figure 12.12. Paginator widget example](images/doctrine/paginator_example.png) 

### Doctrine ORM Paginator

The *Doctrine\ORM* component provides a paginator class named `Paginator` living in `Doctrine\ORM\Tools\Pagination` namespace. 
It can take a Doctrine `Query` object as input and provides several methods for getting paged results (we won't discuss 
those methods here for simplicity). But, Doctrine ORM module doesn't provide any view helpers to visualize the pagination 
widget. For that, we can use the pagination functionality provided by Zend Framework 3. 

I> Although we plan to use ZF3 pagination component, we will still use Doctrine ORM paginator internally for consuming
I> data. ZF3 paginator will be just a wrapper for Doctrine ORM paginator.

### ZF3 Paginator

In Zend Framework 3, pagination is implemented in *Zend\Paginator* component. If you haven't installed this
component, do so by typing the following command:

```
php composer.phar require zendframework/zend-paginator
```

The *Zend\Paginator* component provides the `Paginator` class. Its most useful methods are listed in table 12.6:

{title="Table 12.6. Methods of ZF3 Paginator class"}
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| *Method*                           | *Description*                                      |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `setDefaultScrollingStyle($scrollingStyle = 'Sliding')`  | Sets scrolling style.        |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `setDefaultItemCountPerPage($count)` | Sets maximum count of results per page.          |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `setCurrentPageNumber($pageNumber)` | Sets current page number. |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `count()` | Retuns number of pages.        |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `getTotalItemCount()`  | Returns total number of results.    |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `getCurrentItems()` | Gets items on the current page. |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|

The `Paginator` class is very generic and doesn't know the underlying
data model, so you need to have an adapter which provides the data to paginator. The *DoctrineORMModule* module
provides such adapter (`DoctrineORMModule\Paginator\Adapter\DoctrinePaginator` class) which we can use to get data from ORM
paginator and pass it to ZF3 paginator. 

For example, assume we have a `Query` with a DQL that selects all published posts. 
To get the paginated results with this query, we can use the following code:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php 
use DoctrineORMModule\Paginator\Adapter\DoctrinePaginator as DoctrineAdapter;
use Doctrine\ORM\Tools\Pagination\Paginator as ORMPaginator;
use Zend\Paginator\Paginator;

// Create ZF3 paginator.
$adapter = new DoctrineAdapter(new ORMPaginator($query, false));
$paginator = new Paginator($adapter);

// Set page number and page size.
$paginator->setDefaultItemCountPerPage(10);        
$paginator->setCurrentPageNumber(1);

// Walk through the current page of results.
foreach ($paginator as $post) {
    // Do something with the current post.
}
~~~

Now let's apply this example to our Blog application. We want to display the paginated posts
on the main page of the Blog website.

#### Modifying PostRepository

First of all, we'll have to slightly modify the way we get the list of posts. Previously, we used the `findBy()` method
of the `EntityRepository`, which returns array of posts. But now we'll have to do that with our custom repository class 
`PostRepository`, because Doctrine ORM paginator takes `Query` object on input, not an array of posts.

Add the following method to `PostRepository` class:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
public function findPublishedPosts()
{
    $entityManager = $this->getEntityManager();
    
    $queryBuilder = $entityManager->createQueryBuilder();
    
    $queryBuilder->select('p')
        ->from(Post::class, 'p')
        ->where('p.status = ?1')
        ->orderBy('p.dateCreated', 'DESC')
        ->setParameter('1', Post::STATUS_PUBLISHED);
    
    return $queryBuilder->getQuery();
}
~~~

And change the `findPostsByTag()` method, because we want it to also return `Query` instead of `array`:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
public function findPostsByTag($tagName)
{
    $entityManager = $this->getEntityManager();
    
    $queryBuilder = $entityManager->createQueryBuilder();
    
    $queryBuilder->select('p')
        ->from(Post::class, 'p')
        ->join('p.tags', 't')
        ->where('p.status = ?1')
        ->andWhere('t.name = ?2')
        ->orderBy('p.dateCreated', 'DESC')
        ->setParameter('1', Post::STATUS_PUBLISHED)
        ->setParameter('2', $tagName);
    
    return $queryBuilder->getQuery();
}
~~~ 

T> You will also need to slightly modify the `PostManager::getTagCloud()` method, because it expects an array of posts, but
T> now it will receive the `Query`. It is a simple and obvious modification, so we won't describe how to do that (refer to Blog sample for the complete code). 

#### Modifying IndexController

Next, modify the `indexAction()` method of the `IndexController` as follows:

{line-numbers=on,lang=php}
~~~
<?php
namespace Application\Controller;

// Add aliases for paginator classes
use DoctrineORMModule\Paginator\Adapter\DoctrinePaginator as DoctrineAdapter;
use Doctrine\ORM\Tools\Pagination\Paginator as ORMPaginator;
use Zend\Paginator\Paginator;
// ...

class IndexController extends AbstractActionController 
{
    // ...
    
    public function indexAction() 
    {
        $page = $this->params()->fromQuery('page', 1);
        $tagFilter = $this->params()->fromQuery('tag', null);
        
        if ($tagFilter) {
         
            // Filter posts by tag
            $query = $this->entityManager->getRepository(Post::class)
                    ->findPostsByTag($tagFilter);
            
        } else {
            // Get recent posts
            $query = $this->entityManager->getRepository(Post::class)
                    ->findPublishedPosts();
        }
        
        $adapter = new DoctrineAdapter(new ORMPaginator($query, false));
        $paginator = new Paginator($adapter);
        $paginator->setDefaultItemCountPerPage(1);        
        $paginator->setCurrentPageNumber($page);
                       
        // Get popular tags.
        $tagCloud = $this->postManager->getTagCloud();
        
        // Render the view template.
        return new ViewModel([
            'posts' => $paginator,
            'postManager' => $this->postManager,
            'tagCloud' => $tagCloud
        ]);
    }
}
~~~

You can notice that in line 16 we get the current `page` number from a GET parameter. So, you can set the page of results by entering the
following URL in your browser: "http://localhost/application/index?page=&lt;page&gt;". The default page number is 1.

In lines 22 and 27, we retrieve the `Query` object from our `PostRepository` instead of `array` of posts.
We then pass this `Query` object to the ZF3 paginator in line 31.

In lines 33-34 we set current page number and page size on the paginator.

In line 41, we pass the paginator (!) instead of array of posts for rendering to view template.

#### Visualizing the Pagination Widget

Now it's left the last but not least part of our work. We need to display the pagination 
widget in our view template.

To do that with nice Bootstrap styling, we will need to first create a partial view template *view/application/partial/paginator.phtml* and put the following code
into that file:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?php if ($this->pageCount): ?>

<nav>
<ul class="pagination">

<!-- Previous page link -->
<?php if (isset($this->previous)): ?>
    <li>
      <a href="<?= $this->url($this->route, [], ['query'=>['page'=>$this->previous]]); ?>" aria-label="Previous">
        <span aria-hidden="true">&laquo;</span>
      </a>
    </li>  
<?php else: ?>
    <li>
        <span aria-hidden="true">&laquo;</span>      
    </li>  
<?php endif; ?>

<!-- Numbered page links -->
<?php foreach ($this->pagesInRange as $page): ?>
  <?php if ($page != $this->current): ?>
    <li>
        <a href="<?= $this->url($this->route, [], ['query'=>['page'=>$page]]); ?>"><?= $this->escapeHtml($page); ?></a>
    </li>    
  <?php else: ?>
    <li>
        <span aria-hidden="true"><b><?= $this->escapeHtml($page); ?></b></span> 
    </li>    
  <?php endif; ?>
<?php endforeach; ?>

<!-- Next page link -->
<?php if (isset($this->next)): ?>
    <li>
      <a href="<?php echo $this->url($this->route, [], ['query'=>['page'=>$this->next]]); ?>" aria-label="Next">
        <span aria-hidden="true">&raquo;</span>
      </a>
    </li>  
<?php else: ?>
    <li>
        <span aria-hidden="true">&raquo;</span>      
    </li> 
<?php endif; ?>
</ul>
</nav>
<?php endif; ?>
~~~

The partial view template will be used by the ZF3 `PaginationControl` view helper to visualize the pagination widget. As you
can see, this partial view template takes several input variables (`$pageCount`, `pagesInRange`, `$current`, `$previous`, `$next`, `$route`)
that are used to control how the widget will look like.

Now let's display the widget on our *view/application/index/index.phtml* view template below the list of posts, as follows:

{line-numbers=off,lang=php}
~~~
<?= $this->paginationControl($posts,
            'Sliding',
            'application/partial/paginator', 
            ['route' => 'application']); ?>
~~~ 

The `PaginationControl` view helper accepts four arguments:

  * the `$posts` is the `Paginator` object that we passed from controller's action with the `ViewModel` variable container.
  * the "Sliding" argument is the style of pagination. For additional info on available pagination styles, please refer to Zend Framework documentation.
  * the "application/partial/paginator" is the name of the partial view template containing the markup for the pagination widget.
  * the fourth argument can be used to pass parameters to the partial view template. For example we pass it the `route` parameter, which is used to generate clickable page links.

#### Results

Hooray! Our blog application is ready now. The main page of the website now contains a nice looking pagination widget (see the figure 12.13 below):

![Figure 12.13. Main page with the paginator](images/doctrine/main_page_paginator.png)  

T> In this chapter we implemented only the simplest pagination. For real websites, in addition to pagination, 
T> you might also want to allow interactively sorting your results by certain fields. For such complex tabular data display,
T> consider using the [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) jQuery plugin.

## Summary

Doctrine is not part of Zend Framework 3, but we cover its usage in this book because it provides
an easy way of accessing a database and providing object persistence to your application. 

In this chapter, we've covered the usage of the Object Relational Mapper (ORM) component of the
Doctrine library. The ORM is designed for database management in an object-oriented style. With ORM,
you map a database table to a PHP class known as an entity. Columns of that table are mapped to the 
properties of the entity class. 

To load data from the database, you retrieve an entity from its repository. The repository is a class
that can be considered as a collection of all available entities. The repository loads data from the 
corresponding database table, and fills one or more entity instance's fields with that data.
